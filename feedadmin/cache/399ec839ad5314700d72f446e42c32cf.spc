<p>Two  years ago I stumbled across the concept of blogging for money.  Instantly  it hit me as the perfect thing: sit behind a computer, design a site,  write, be my own boss, work from home, what could be better? I  knew nothing about traffic, SEO, backlinks, Pagerank, or keywords.  I knew  nothing about how to make money with a website.  So what did I do next?   I registered the domain name howthiswebsitemakesmoney.</p>
<p>Looking  back all I can do is laugh at my arrogance.  Like thousands before me and thousands who will come after me, my first attempt at blogging was a site about  making money online.</p>
<p>Two  years later, I know how to start a site, I know how to write content, I  know about SEO, I know about backlinks, I know how to add advertisements &#8230; but I  still do not know how to make good money online.  The site makes dimes a  day, not dollars.</p>
<p>The  site has been two years of disappointment.  Two  years of waking up in  the morning and seeing the same green egg in AdSense.  Two years of waiting  for a four-digit affiliate check with my name on it.  Two years of working  without pay.  Two years of scratching my head.</p>
<p>So  I asked for advice, and every time the reply was the same: create a site  about something else. Create a site about what you know and what you enjoy.   Do not create a site with the intent to make money, create a site with the  intent to help people by doing something you enjoy doing.</p>
<h2>What happened when I changed my intent</h2>
<p>Six months ago I created a new site.  This time my intent was pure pleasure.</p>
<p>I  live in Prague and I love it here.  So I made a little site about how great Prague is and what people should do when they come for a visit.  It was built in a month.  In a gust of activity I designed the site and wrote the content.</p>
<p>It  was so easy.   I did not agonize over what to write about.  The  content flowed effortlessly from my head to the keyboard.  I did not have to take long walks with the dog or waste water standing dazed in the shower coming up with new ideas.  I just sat down at the computer and wrote about what I know.  It was so easy I actually looked forward to it.</p>
<p>As an afterthought, I created a simple page where people can order a real postcard from Prague.  Visitors select a picture of Prague and fill out a form indicating what they want written on the postcard.  After they hit the Submit button I get the request by email.  I grab a postcard and, like an ancient scribe long before computers, lick the tip of the pen and write.   After pounding a Prague stamp on the postcard I toss it into the mailbox on my way to work. I charge $4.00 for this five minutes of work.</p>
<p>I created this site with no aspirations of becoming rich, no day dreams of shaking hands with Oprah, no imagined scenes of telling my employer to find some other donkey to kick around. I created the website because it  was easy for me to do and I enjoyed it. I made it because I needed a  break from my ‘real’ website. I expected nothing to  happen.</p>
<p>Again, I was wrong.</p>
<p>My hand is ink blue from all the postcards I have written.</p>
<p>I wrote a postcard from a son playing a trick on his mother: “Hi, Mom!  Sorry for not calling in last few days.  But I am in Prague with friends.  Having a great time and the beer is sooo cheap.  Say hi to Dad.”</p>
<p>I  have written postcards to countries all over the world.  Some of them in languages other then English—I have no idea what I am writing. Fortunately, the  order form does not allow Chinese characters!</p>
<p>I  get emails from people thanking me for the information they found on the site,  thanking me for the postcard, asking for more information.</p>
<p>I  feel like I am making the world a better place.  I made a website about something I know about and am interested in and people are thanking me.  Emotionally it is a soft, warm, fuzzy ball.</p>
<p>And yes, I am making money.</p>
<h2>Intend to enjoy and you might make money</h2>
<p>I learned a lot about making money online not from my site about making money, but from licking postage stamps.</p>
<p>New arrivals to the make-money-online scene go through the same initiation—they  start out with the intent to make money, then fail to make more then a pile of  pennies.  For some it means the end and they quit, but for others this brutal introduction teaches them that their intent needs to change.</p>
<p>Of course, making money is about traffic, clicks, affiliates, backlinks SEO, but it&#8217;s also about finding something you enjoy doing.  If your intent is only to  make money the odds are stacked against you: you will probably quit.  But  if your intent is to do something you enjoy then you will keep moving forward until one day, you will be surprised to find that you are making money.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your intent?</p>
<p><em>Roman intends to figure out <a href="http://www.howthiswebsitemakesmoney.com/" target="_blank">how this website makes money</a>.  He has been trying to do that for two long years, so  when he needs a break and do something fun he goes onto his other website  to <a href="http://www.pragueczechtravel.com/send-real-postcard.php" target="_blank">send a real  postcard</a> to his mother who misses him very much.</em></p>

<p>As a blog business owner, your brand needs to reach beyond your blog.</p>
<p>Your presence on social media is a valuable one. In some ways, it’s the ultimate opt-in. When someone follows you on Twitter, subscribes to your YouTube channel or likes your Facebook page they’re making a choice to connect with you—and are receptive to your message.</p>
<p>These communication channels become assets for you to cultivate loyalty, relationships, and importantly, influence.</p>
<p>These assets are valuable not only for you, but for advertisers also. More and more, my advertising leads are inquiring about social media reach. They don’t just want a banner ad on my website—they want their brand exposed to my social networks.</p>
<p>There are creative ways to add more value for advertisers (in exchange for higher rates) without being spammy. You don’t want to sell your soul and lose the trust that you’ve built, but there’s no reason why you can’t monetize the attention of your audience beyond your blog.</p>
<h2>Ways to use social media to offer more value to advertisers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Publish a blog post to welcome a new sponsor and tweet about it.</li>
<li>Publish a monthly &#8220;Editor’s picks&#8221; post including from your advertiser’s products/service range.</li>
<li>Continue this by linking to a page within an advertiser&#8217;s products/service range from Facebook.</li>
<li>Add a page to your Facebook account detailing monthly special offers that you’ve negotiated with your advertisers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure in all cases that the line between all advertising/editorial is clearly drawn and appropriately marked.</p>
<p>Add your social media statistics to your media kit and include any extras that advertisers will receive when they choose to book a campaign with you. You’ll get extra dollars for minimal extra work, and your advertisers will receive extra value.</p>
<p>Haven’t separated your personal social media accounts from your blog’s yet? Next week I’ll explore the pros and cons of doing just that.</p>

Yet so many bloggers struggle to produce content that engages with and meets the needs of readers.</p>
<p>As a result, Chris Garrett and I have put together a brand new short course—<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/launch/crea-kil-con">Create Killer Content for your Blog</a>—to help set you on the right track.</p>
<p>The course is presented over five modules (in five days):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li>Planning your content: coming up with ideas, finding your voice, types of posts to try</li>
<li>Structuring your content: writing your content in a way that works</li>
<li>Polishing your content: taking good content and making it great</li>
<li>Killer multimedia content: podcasts, interviews, slide shows, and video</li>
<li>Live webinar: a Q&amp;A call with myself and Chris at the end of the week.</li>
</ol>
<p>This course starts Monday, 6 December and it costs just $29.95 (or $99 if you bundle it with the other <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/launch/pillars-problog">3 upcoming Pillars of ProBlogger courses</a>).</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t do it all in the week in which the course is scheduled, don&#8217;t worry: you&#8217;ll have access to all the course materials for 12 months, so you can take it at your own pace.</p>
<h2>Who is this short course for?</h2>
<p>Creating Killer content is for you if&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>you&#8217;re struggling with producing content for your blog</li>
<li>you&#8217;re trying to find your voice as a blogger</li>
<li>you&#8217;ve run out of ideas to write about</li>
<li>you&#8217;re just looking for a little refresher and/or inspiration.</li>
</ul>

<p>This discount applies to all of their themes and frameworks, including:</p>

</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve switched two of my main blogs over to StudioPress themes in the last few weeks, and have been very impressed by the results. They&#8217;re fast loading, well optimized for search engines, and simple to use and secure.</p>
<p>The team at StudioPress also tell me that as of Tuesday (when this ends) they won&#8217;t be doing any more discounting—this is their last sale.</p>
<p>Make the most of it and <a href="http://bit.ly/fC6Fn5">secure a StudioPress theme</a> today.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I&#8217;m an affiliate of StudioPress. As a user of StudioPress products I&#8217;m more than happy to recommend them. That&#8217;s why my face is on the front page of their site telling the world how much I love them!</p>

<p>Working with so many merchants and affiliates gives us a great opportunity to see what different bloggers are trying to do to generate sales of affiliate products, and over time we’ve noticed that some strategies work much better than others.</p>
<p>These are the top five affiliate sales techniques we’ve seen work time and time again.</p>
<h2>1. Only promote products you’re willing to stand behind 100%.</h2>
<p>We had one incident on our site where someone bought something from a third party, didn&#8217;t like it, and got so mad that they launched a Denial of Service attack on us!</p>
<p>It’s very common for us to receive emails from people who buy stuff from our merchants but get mad at us for allowing people to sell what they see as substandard products. Initially we used to tell them that this is akin to writing to Bill Gates complaining that someone who made budgeting software using Excel didn&#8217;t do a good job, but now if we get too many complaints we just get rid of the product.</p>
<p>We have a certain brand that gets attached to whatever is being sold using our platform, and if a product is bad, people view us negatively, even though we have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>The same applies to your blog.</p>
<p>Your customers will see very little difference between your products and the affiliate products you sell. They’ll blame you if they don&#8217;t like the affiliate product. Only promote products you really love, and are willing to back 100%—or your readers will lose their faith in you.</p>
<h2>2. Don’t be afraid to experiment.</h2>
<p>The range of products that our merchants sell never ceases to amaze me. Recently we featured a seller whose product is <a href="http://www.fleces.com/">poo-shaped pillows</a>! No, that’s not a typo: these pillows are colored and shaped like poo.</p>
<p>You never know what will work until you try it out—many times you’ll think about something, assume it won’t work, and move on to something else. Yet the Internet makes experimentation so cheap and so easily measurable that you should give all your ideas some time before you drop them. You never know what will bring you the next million!</p>
<h2>3. Reviews work much better for affiliate sales than buttons, widgets, or advertisements.</h2>
<p>In Darren’s <em><a href="http://www.problogger.net/31dbbb-workbook/">31 Days to a Better Blog</a></em> book, the exercise for Day 28 is writing a review post that includes an affiliate link.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this approach work much better, as far as conversions are concerned, than advertisements, widgets, or buttons on your website. You may drive a lot more traffic to your sales page using buttons, but contextual links in reviews have much better conversion rates.</p>
<h2>4. Think of your customer service as your product.</h2>
<p>If we see a merchant who offers first-rate customer service, we know that they’re going to be big. There&#8217;s so much commoditization in so many industries that it becomes difficult for customers to choose between products, and for merchants to be heard. Great customer service is something that easily cuts through this clutter.</p>
<p>Sometimes people will buy your product just because they know that you will pick up their call or answer their emails. When you put customer service on the same pedestal as your core product, you will see an attitude shift in the way you deal with your customers, and also the way they see you.</p>
<h2>5. Don’t lose your customer at the last step.</h2>
<p>One of our core mantras is to make our product as easy to use as possible, and we see a lot of other successful merchants do that too.</p>
<p>There are two key ways of doing this: simplify your product, and provide as much detailed documentation as you can on how to use it.</p>
<p>While there are limits to simplifying the product, you can always provide a great amount of detail on how to use your product, or how to become your affiliate.</p>
<p>Leo Babauta’s <a href="http://zenhabits.net/affiliates/">step-by-step directions</a> on what to do when you want to join Zen Habits as an affiliate are a great example of what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>A user can walk through that whole process without any confusion, and providing such great detail can vastly improve your conversion rates. You really don’t want to lose your customer at the last step just because your instructions weren’t clear. It’s so hard to get people’s attention, and convince them to try your product. Don’t let them fail to sign up just because they can’t understand the directions on your site—that’s the last thing you want to happen.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to figure out any of this stuff—it all makes so sense when you think about it.<br />
The reason why affiliates and merchants fail to follow this advice isn’t because it’s hard to figure, but because execution is difficult. Doing the right thing, day in and day out, over and over for years, is what makes the difference between generating a six-figure income online, and the rest of the blogosphere.</p>
<p>Keep these best practices in mind—but also focus on executing them as much as you can. What tips can you add to this list?</p>

<p>Three weeks ago I wrote a guest post for a large blog that got rejected on the grounds that it contained ideas that had already been discussed at the blog. Now that same post is bringing me hundreds of email subscribers every week. Let me tell you what happened—and explain how you can replicate some of that success.</p>

<h2>How I turned a failed post into a subscriber magnet</h2>
<p>Ever since I first thought about <a href="http://www.blogtyrant.com/how-i-sold-a-blog-for-20000-in-8-months/">selling a blog</a> I knew that I had to grow my email subscriber list. I&#8217;ve talked about it in my post on <a href="http://www.blogtyrant.com/how-to-blog/">how to blog</a> and I&#8217;ve talked about here on my Problogger guest posts. It is your mailing list that allows you to grow a large online business that outlasts the ups and downs and brings in considerable income.</p>
<h3>The rejected post</h3>
<p>Seeing as I had spent a fair amount of time building sites and blogs, and experimenting with growing a mailing list I thought I would make it a regular theme on Blog Tyrant. People seemed interested. In order to grow my readership, though, I knew I had to write exciting and relevant guest posts about themes that are closely tied to my blog. So I wrote an article called <em>How to Grow Your Email List by 120% Overnight</em> that talked about some strategies I had used to massively boost my email subscribers.</p>
<p>It got rejected. Actually, it&#8217;s the only guest post I&#8217;ve ever had rejected.</p>
<h3>The free ebook</h3>
<p>After I had cooled down and patched up the hole I punched in my office wall I sat there staring at the post. For some reason I didn&#8217;t want to just use it on my own blog. Something was telling me not to. Then, on a whim, I thought I would just turn it into a <a href="http://www.blogtyrant.com/free-ebook/">free ebook</a> and give it away on my site to anyone who subscribed by email (nothing new). I wrote the copy, added the email subscription form and went to bed. The next day my email subscribers had gone up by 200 addresses. The day after that, 120 addresses. Hundreds of people were subscribing to my blog to get this free ebook.</p>
<h2>Why is this ebook so successful?</h2>
<p>I started to wonder why this ebook was so successful. I have other blogs that give away free ebooks but none of them seem to pull in subscribers at the rate this one does. After a while, I realized that I&#8217;d carried out a strategy without even thinking about it. In an effort to promote <a href="http://blogtyrant.com">my new site</a>, I had inadvertently pre-promoted the launch of my ebook.</p>
<p>I went back and looked at all the guest posts I&#8217;d written in the past few weeks which were still bringing in traffic. In every single one, I had talked about growing a mailing list, the importance of community, or something to do with that rejected-post-turned-ebook.</p>
<p>In essence, I had built a whole lot of hype around the ebook without even realizing that I was doing it. If I was a marketing firm I would have charged a lot of money for that strategy!</p>
<h2>How to replicate that success</h2>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4010/5149331635_0dae7de55b.jpg" border="0" alt="Duesenberg SSJ Roadster replica" /><br />
<small><a title="Attribution License" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.blogtyrant.com/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png" border="0" alt="Creative Commons License" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" /></a> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a title="Ed Callow [ torquespeak ]" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31797562@N04/5149331635/" target="_blank">Ed Callow [ torquespeak ]</a></small></p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve admitted to the shameful fact that I did all this by accident, I want to talk about a few ways that you can replicate that success on your own blogs. These few steps are key to making sure the whole thing goes down well.</p>
<h3>1. Research that ebook subject hard.</h3>
<p>The subject of that ebook is of utmost importance. I go to so many sites where the free ebook is a bit wishy-washy and not really that exciting. You don&#8217;t want that. Look at your analytics and find out why people are coming to your site. Look at competitors&#8217; blogs and see what posts have gone viral. Find bestsellers in your niche. Research hard and come up with a subject and title that&#8217;s really compelling to the people that you write for.</p>
<p>To be honest, the title and subject are almost more important than the content. Sure, my ebook has excellent tips that I really did use, but it&#8217;s not even 20 pages long, and it only took me about an hour to put together including the coding and the cover design. You want to make sure you get it right.</p>
<h3>2. Create guest posts that target and promote your ebook.</h3>
<p>Here is where the magic takes place. You want to write a good ten or 15 guest posts for blogs in your niche that target readers of your new ebook. Now, you don&#8217;t have to directly mention the ebook like I&#8217;ve done in this post. You just need to generate interest, as I managed to do in my other Problogger guest posts <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/10/05/three-problems-that-make-me-leave-your-blog-in-three-seconds/">Why I Leave Your Blog</a>, <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/08/23/how-to-make-your-blog-addictive-like-world-of-warcraft/">How to Make Your Blog Addictive</a>, and <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/11/10/why-your-blog-is-not-going-to-make-you-rich-or-pay-the-bills/">Why Your Blog is Not Going to Make You Rich</a>.</p>
<p>None of those posts <em>directly</em> mention any ebook, but they do spend a lot of time talking about mailing lists and growing a community as a way to make big dollars. If you landed on my blog after reading one of those posts and saw the ebook, you&#8217;d probably be more likely to download it than any other random visitor. In the affiliate marketing world, this is called pre-selling; Darren calls it a <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2007/08/18/create-a-sneeze-page-and-propel-readers-deep-within-your-blog/">sneeze page</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Generate more interest in the comments.</h3>
<p>Once your guest posts are published, it&#8217;s important to get over to the pushing site and interact with people in the comments. Share as much as you can about the topic, and try to dispel any objections that people might have. What you&#8217;re doing by taking this course of action is giving people a secondary gentle push in your blog&#8217;s direction. They might not love you after they read your guest post, but they certainly should be open to liking you after you talk to them in the comments.</p>
<h3>4. Make sure your call to action is strong.</h3>
<p>The last thing you need to do is make sure the signup area on your blog contains a good, clean, strong call to action. Put it in one of the <a href="http://www.blogtyrant.com/blog-hot-areas/">blog hot areas</a>. Make sure you use copy that gets people excited, and allows them to give you their email without worrying that you&#8217;re going to abuse it. Most internet marketers agree that you need to use a direct call to action that tells your visitors exactly what they need to do to subscribe. Don&#8217;t leave it up to chance.</p>
<h2>Bonus: how to give away a free ebook with Feedburner</h2>
<p>Not everyone out there can afford to use <a href="http://www.aweber.com/">Aweber</a> to give away free ebooks to email subscribers. Unless you&#8217;re making good revenue, it can be a little bit expensive. For that reason, I want to show you how to do it completely free with <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a>. It&#8217;s not quite as efficient, but it works well for me and a lot of other bloggers.</p>
<h3>1. Upload your ebook to your server.</h3>
<p>Go to your FTP area and upload your ebook into the root folder. If it&#8217;s small enough you can just go into your WordPress Dashboard and upload the PDF as an image. Copy the address of the ebook.</p>
<h3>2. Get your FeedFlare template.</h3>
<p>While your FTP is open,<a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/feedflaretemplate.zip"> download this file</a>. Unzip it, open it up with Notepad or Wordpad (not Word) and edit the information that I&#8217;ve filled out for you. Once you are done, hit save and upload it to your root directory without changing the name at all. It should appear as an XML file if you&#8217;ve done it right.</p>
<h3>3. Edit Feedburner</h3>
<p>Now log in to your Feedburner account and activate FeedFlare (it&#8217;s under Optimize). Scroll down to the Personal FeedFlare heading and add the URL of the XML file that you just uploaded to your root directory. The URL should be <code>http://youblog.com/feedflaretemplate.xml</code></p>
<h3>4. You&#8217;re done!</h3>
<p>Every time someone receives a Feedburner message from you, there will be a little ebook download link at the bottom of the post. I&#8217;d recommend making an instructions page for people so they don&#8217;t email you asking where it is. Just let them know that the free ebook will be at the bottom of the posts that arrive in their inbox.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This strategy of pre-promoting an ebook has worked extremely well for me in the past few weeks. I&#8217;m getting hundreds of new subscribers every week, and they are all turning out to be valuable members of my community who comment, interact, and share my posts. Try it out if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d really like to know if you know any other ways to promote your blog or a product on your blog. Please drop a comment and let me know.</p>

Hopefully you&#8217;ll find ProBlogger a little easier to navigate and a little less cluttered.</p>
<p>There are quite a few changes in the back end of the site, though, in that we&#8217;ve moved over to the <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=242694&amp;u=286361&amp;m=28169&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">Genesis framework</a>. Brian Gardner from <a href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=241369&amp;u=286361&amp;m=28169&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=">StudioPress</a> has been incredibly helpful in getting us set up—I can&#8217;t recommend their themes enough!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/problogger-new-theme2.png"><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/problogger-new-theme-tm1.jpg" alt="problogger-new-theme.png" width="639" height="530" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you look over the theme for yourself to see how we&#8217;ve gone about it. There are a lot of small changes including:</p>
<ul>
<li>threaded comments—something that has been requested a lot</li>
<li>more prominent social media promotion of our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/problogger">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/problogger">Twitter</a> accounts</li>
<li>a refreshed front page with new featured-post layout</li>
<li>videos now are full size on single post pages (not more squinting)</li>
<li>those who leave comments will be depicted in an avatar alongside their comments (pulled in via <a href="http://www.gravatar.com">Gravatar</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few other small tweaks around the site, and there will be at least a couple of new additions in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there will also be a few small bugs that we&#8217;ll need to iron out, but overall things are pretty stable and I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing your feedback (give those threaded comments a workout)!</p>
<p>PS: Some people have commented on Twitter that they want the Subscribe to Comments feature switched back on. I&#8217;m interested to hear whether that&#8217;s the consensus—let me know what you think.</p>

<p>How creative are you? A lot of bloggers feel that they&#8217;re not very creative people. Perhaps they come from a technical background. Perhaps they&#8217;ve never picked up a paintbrush in their life, and think that means they’re not creative. Perhaps they see creativity as something for other people.</p>
<p>The truth is, if you&#8217;re blogging—or even planning a blog—then you&#8217;re already much more creative than a lot of folks.<br />
As a blogger, you&#8217;re not just creating content (though that&#8217;s the biggest area where you&#8217;ll be exercising your creative muscles).</p>
<p>Right from the start, you&#8217;re also creating:</p>
<ul>
<li>the brand for your blog</li>
<li> your business plan and blogging strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you&#8217;re bootstrapping your blog (almost all of us are, when we start out), you may well be creating:</p>
<ul>
<li> your logo and site header</li>
<li>the look and feel of your blog (the fonts and colors you choose, for instance).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re a little further along with blogging, you&#8217;ll be looking at creating extras like:</p>
<ul>
<li> a regular email newsletter</li>
<li> ebooks</li>
<li> audio programs</li>
<li> physical books</li>
<li> membership content.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that involves a lot of focused thinking, hard work, and a few sparks of inspiration.</p>
<h2>Why creativity is so important for bloggers</h2>
<p>When you visit a new blog, what encourages you to stick around? I&#8217;d guess it&#8217;s the quality of the content and the overall design.</p>
<p>If the posts are original and well-written, the blog looks good, and the topics fit together, then you&#8217;ll probably read on.</p>
<p>But if the posts comprise scrappy content, or long quotes from other people&#8217;s blogs, you&#8217;ll be gone within seconds. If the blog&#8217;s design looks like something from 1995, you probably won&#8217;t stay long. And if there&#8217;s no sense of cohesion—no plan or brand—then even if the content is good, you&#8217;ll probably not want to read yet another post about that cute thing the blogger&#8217;s cat did.</p>
<p>Your blog will succeed or fail on the strength of your creativity.</p>
<p>Blogs start to fail when bloggers:</p>
<ul>
<li> get burnt out and carry on posting substandard content out of a sense of obligation</li>
<li> get tired and just post links to other people&#8217;s content</li>
<li> get bored and stop posting for weeks on end.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be wacky and weird in your creativity. It&#8217;s fine if your style is quite straight-laced, or casual and laid back, rather than humorous. You don&#8217;t have to have a complex metaphor or a really neat hook for every single post.</p>
<p>But you do need to create. Which means <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/08/12/how-to-craft-a-blog-post-10-crucial-points-to-pause/">crafting your blog posts</a>, not dashing them off. It takes energy, focus and dedication.</p>
<h2>How to be creative—all the time</h2>
<p>A lot of the folks I talk to seem a bit scared of creativity. They&#8217;re convinced that it&#8217;s something mystical or magical, like a bolt of lightning from the heavens.</p>
<p>The reality is that we&#8217;re all naturally creative. Not convinced? Think about your dreams: we&#8217;re all capable of making up wonderful stories and vivid pictures in our minds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important, though, to nurture your creativity—especially as you go further and further with your blogging. You might well feel hugely excited and motivated when you&#8217;re getting started with your blog, only to gradually lose that sense of inspiration and <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/09/09/how-to-re-ignite-your-blogging-fire-when-youre-feeling-burnt-out/">run out of steam</a>. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with you—you just haven&#8217;t been focused on keeping your creativity bubbling away.</p>
<h3>Write on topics you care about</h3>
<p>This is crucial for me, and for many of the bloggers I talk to. You&#8217;ll find it tough to write consistently on a topic which bores you.</p>
<p>Sure, celebrity blogs might be big business. But if you couldn&#8217;t care less who&#8217;s sleeping with whom, then you&#8217;re better off writing about something else. Comic books, fine art, food, personal finance—whatever interests you.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got a blog on a topic in which you&#8217;ve lost interest, see if you can find a particular angle that gives you a way back in. Maybe you&#8217;re fed up with writing about the technical specifications of the latest gadgets, but you could easily create a series on the innovative use of technology in the developing world.</p>
<h3>Keeping learning more</h3>
<p>Whenever I go to a conference, like <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/10/01/15-tips-for-getting-the-most-out-of-blog-world-expo/">BlogWorld</a>, I come back with a bunch of ideas. There&#8217;s something invigorating about learning new things—and it often gets me back into a creative mood if I&#8217;ve been in a bit of a rut.</p>
<p>Of course, you don&#8217;t need to go to conferences to learn (though if you can make it to South by South West or BlogWorld, they&#8217;re well worth the investment). There&#8217;s a huge amount of learning material available for bloggers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>free blog posts here on ProBlogger, as well as on other blogs like <a href="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/">Daily Blog Tips</a>, <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/">Copyblogger</a>, and <a href="http://menwithpens.ca/">Men with Pens</a></li>
<li>free podcasts such as <a href="http://www.blopgcastfm.com/">BlogCastFM</a></li>
<li>ebooks and other downloadables like <a href="http://www.problogger.net/31dbbb-workbook/">31 Days to Build a Better Blog</a> (I don&#8217;t think anyone could work through that and not come up with dozens of new ideas!)</li>
<li>online courses like <a href="http://courses.sitepoint.com/gettingstartedblogging">Getting Started Blogging</a> (which is free) or <a href="http://courses.sitepoint.com/problogger-academy">The ProBlogger Academy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d suggest setting aside one hour, twice a week, just for learning. That might mean listening to an audio program, reading a section of an ebook, or browsing through blog archives. Use a notebook or blank document on your computer to jot down your thoughts.</p>
<h3>Write down all your ideas</h3>
<p>Ever had a great idea when you were out walking, on the bus, or watching TV?</p>
<p>Often, ideas don&#8217;t crop up when you&#8217;re at your computer. They&#8217;re sparked off by something which you see or do, and they pop into your head at the oddest moments.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so easy for those ideas to slip away, or to end up half-remembered. If you&#8217;ve got a notebook in your bag, you can just scribble them down—you may even find yourself outlining a whole blog post or an entirely new strategy.</p>
<p>In fact, any time that you&#8217;re fleshing out an idea, try writing it down. It&#8217;s often easier to think things through when you start to put them into a physical form, rather than trying to hold everything in your head.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t force yourself to create</h3>
<p>Some days, you don&#8217;t want to sit down at the computer and write. But you drag yourself there anyway. You open up a document and stare at it for a bit. You resist the urge to check email, or play on Twitter.</p>
<p>You make yourself write.</p>
<p>You think you&#8217;re doing the right thing—after all, isn&#8217;t this what all the productivity experts would advise?<br />
So after a couple of miserable hours, when you&#8217;ve finally managed a half-hearted post, you shove it onto your blog and go and do something fun.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t get as many comments as usual. You don&#8217;t get retweets or links. And the next day, you feel even more fed up. But you sit down to write anyway…</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping you can see why this is a mistake. Creativity isn&#8217;t something you can force. Sure, you can probably apply a bit of self-discipline when you need to get the dishes done or clear your emails—but writing blog posts takes energy, and a certain amount of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>A number of the bloggers I talked to at BlogWorld said that they&#8217;d rather not write a post at all if they&#8217;re really not inspired—and I agree with them.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t force yourself to create. Give yourself a regular time and place to write, but if you&#8217;re really not in the mood, take a break and do something else instead.</p>
<h2>When you need inspiration</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you&#8217;re keen to write, but you&#8217;re just not sure where to start. You want to write a blog post, or come up with an ebook outline, or get a brilliant headline for your latest piece—but that creative spark needs lighting first.</p>
<p>Here are four easy ways to find that inspiration.</p>
<h3>Start with an image</h3>
<p>If you use images for your posts, you probably write the post first and choose the image afterwards, right?</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re stuck, head over to Flickr, looking for a great image, then write the post to go with it.</p>
<p>As soon as you start looking at an image, your brain will begin to make connections and see possibilities. The picture you choose doesn’t have to have any obvious relationship to your blog&#8217;s niche—in fact, a seemingly-unconnected image will usually work best for sparking your creativity.</p>
<h3>Brainstorm on paper</h3>
<p>Staring at a blank Word document or the text box in WordPress?</p>
<p>Grab a piece of paper and a pen, and start jotting down ideas. If you&#8217;ve no clue where to begin, write down your blog&#8217;s name or topic in the center, or use your list of categories.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t judge your ideas at this stage—write them all down, however unoriginal or boring they might seem. You&#8217;ll find that the ideas start flowing after a few minutes, and often a weak idea can lead to a great one.</p>
<h3>Read news articles in your area</h3>
<p>This works better for some niches than others, but often a news report can bring you a new idea. If you&#8217;re writing about health and fitness, you might look into some of the latest scientific research. If you cover techy topics, there&#8217;ll always be something new to write about.</p>
<p>Even evergreen content can be inspired by a news article. A report on average happiness levels, for instance, could lead to a thoughtful post on why we&#8217;re less happy today than in the past—despite generally having a better quality of life than people living 50 years ago.</p>
<h3>Do something else entirely</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re waiting for an idea to develop, try getting away from your computer. Go for a walk, take a shower, tidy your office—anything that doesn&#8217;t require much mental effort. The thoughts you&#8217;ve been playing around with will continue to develop, and you&#8217;ll often find that a great idea comes effortlessly into your mind.</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t forget your notebook so you can write it down…</p>

<p>Another great feature of WPTouch is that it allows you to post metrics code into the the ads, so you get a true picture of how many people are viewing your site not only on the normal theme, but also on the mobile one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using WPTouch for a number of months now, but I&#8217;d never added Google Analytics code to it. As a result I was undercounting visitors to my site.</p>
<p>A few days back, I added Google Analytics code to my WPTouch theme, and was amazed to see just how many of our viewers are viewing the site using that theme. Following is a chart of mobile device viewers accessing Digital Photography School. Up until I added the Analytics code, it was only counting mobile device users who were using the normal dPS theme—it wasn&#8217;t counting those using WPTouch.</p>
<p>Since I added the code, the stats skyrocketed from an average of 700 a day to around 4000 a day! That means about 5% of the blog&#8217;s readers now view it on mobile devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/mobile-traffic.png"><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/mobile-traffic-tm.jpg" alt="mobile-traffic.png" width="600" height="189" /></a></p>
<p>Again, this isn&#8217;t an increase in actual traffic: it&#8217;s just a more accurate count. But it&#8217;s worth noting that if you are using a mobile version of your site, you should pick a theme that you can measure.</p>

<p>Personal blogging has changed a lot in the last two years. Some writers now run blogs or social media campaigns to extend their profiles for current (and future) readers; some bloggers are using their reach to find or be offered writing work.</p>
<p>The line between ‘writing’ and ‘blogging’ is blurring, which is terrific, but can also be confusing. I know this first-hand. So today I’m going to share with you some points I try to keep foremost in mind. Maybe they’ll help you too.</p>
<h2>Making money is possible, but prepare for tough decisions</h2>
<p>Here’s a description: you’ve built up a pretty healthy traffic flow, or a solid RSS subscriber count. Long before that, you signed up to an ad network, thinking that by this stage the money would be steadily coming in … except it’s not.</p>
<p>You think about selling private ad spaces, but worry that would be a turn-off for your audience. You’re hesitant about doing sponsored or affiliate-related posts for the same reason. And as for all those opportunities out there in waiting, the longer you’re stuck, the harder they seem to be to grab.</p>
<p>Does this scenario sound familiar? Well, I’ve got a message of hope for the personal bloggers out there. You have one thing on your side. You’re making decisions that matter every day. Here are just a few: how much or little do I reveal about myself or my family? What are some ways I can frame or contextualize a story for effect? What is the best response I can give if I’m challenged about an issue? </p>
<p>What’s needed to answer those questions? Integrity. Look into that part of yourself when asking yourself how far you’re willing to go to make money from your blog. The answer is often there waiting.</p>
<h2>Making sure ‘I’ am enough</h2>
<p>Here’s another description: you’re chatting to a friend who also blogs, but does so in more traffic-heavy niches (such as entertainment and technologies). You compare the time you spend and your blogging tactics, and are roughly doing it the same way. The difference is that your friend’s site’s hits are triple yours. You start to feel discouraged.</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar? My message this time is a little more sobering. Yes, it can be hard, but this is the time when you need to decide if you are enough. Does it really matter if your traffic isn’t like so-and-so’s? Perhaps your ambitions can be channeled differently, or your goals need redefining. </p>
<p>It never hurts to stop, take a step back, and see what personal bloggers have achieved in recent years. People who live with or are affected by mental or medical challenges, for example, have been able to raise their voices to advocate the networks which support them and are, in turn, worth being supported by others. </p>
<p>Personal blogging isn’t easy—you might be surprised how many other people feel the same way. This is why meetups and conferences are so important: they create opportunities for open discussion and learning among like-minded peers. It’s also worth remembering that your blog will go through its ups and downs, just as all lives do.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling, perhaps take a day—or a week—off to clear your mind and refocus. It might make the difference between two or three mediocre posts or one terrific one. It might make the difference between quitting or sticking it out. At these times we need to take care of ourselves. We’re all worth looking after. </p>

<p>A frame is a great way to communicate information. In journalism, it&#8217;s called a hook, or story angle. In marketing, the frame is provided by a product&#8217;s unique selling proposition. And a frame is something that bloggers can use to immediately draw users in and keep them reading.</p>
<div id="attachment_12790" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 257px"><a href="http://www.sxc.hu/photo/1232103"><img class="size-full wp-image-12790" title="1232103_baroque_frame" src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/1232103_baroque_frame.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image by stock.xchng user pale</p></div>
<p>A frame is what makes the difference between the headline &#8220;Three things bloggers should consider in writing a post&#8221; and a headline that reads, &#8220;Blood, Sweat and Tears: Writing Advice I Learned the Hard Way.&#8221;</p>
<p>A frame is what makes the difference between an unfocused collection of disparate thoughts about setting up a home gym, and a post whose clear structure takes the reader on a journey through your experience setting up your own home gym.</p>
<p>A frame is what gives readers a reason to read: it promises a deliverable or outcome that you can highlight in your headline, promise in your teaser or opening paragraph, and shape your entire piece around. It lets your readers know what they&#8217;re getting—and how they can fit that information into their existing knowledge bank—before they even click the link to the full blog post for the complete picture.</p>
<p>As you can see, context—a frame—is an incredibly valuable tool for the blogger.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>How can you put a frame around a basic idea that you&#8217;ve had for a post? Different authors take different approaches, but here are a few of the most common that I know of.</p>
<h3>Headline first</h3>
<p>Some authors choose to write a headline first, then use it to frame their content. They might know they have a content gap in their blog—say, on the basics of birthday cake decoration—and they might write a snappy headline first: &#8220;Dragons to Dragsters: Breathtaking Birthday Cake Ideas&#8221;, for example.</p>
<p>Then they&#8217;ll plan the article around that theme. Perhaps they&#8217;ll have a section on organic-shaped cakes, and one on cakes that look like man-made objects. Perhaps they&#8217;ll shape the post for different age brackets, starting with the dragon for young children&#8217;s birthdays, and working through different possibilities, arriving at the dragster cake last, for adults.</p>
<p>As you can see from this example, a headline can offer a number of possibilities for framing your article. It can provide a great starting point for a frame.</p>
<h3>Topic first</h3>
<p>Sometimes, the topic itself will offer you a frame for the content. Writing a post on your favorite golf courses? Why not make your list contain either nine or 18 courses, to reflect the number of holes in a game?</p>
<p>Perhaps your post on mixing the perfect Martini could be structured to reflect the steps in the process: icing the glass, rinsing it with vermouth, preparing the garnish, and so on. Or perhaps you&#8217;ll shape it around quotes about Martinis from celebrities, books, or movies.</p>
<p>Clearly, the topic of your post can provide you with a plethora of hooks or angles. Don&#8217;t just go for the most obvious ones: though. Sometimes, it&#8217;s the least-common aspect of a topic that provides fresh ground, and a new perspective for writers. Instead of reviewing the latest sci-fi flick like every other film blogger, you might choose the aspect you felt was the best in the movie—perhaps the soundtrack, or the cast—and use that as the viewpoint from which to review the film.</p>
<h3>Content first</h3>
<p>This is usually the approach I use: I write the content, the process of which gives me a few ideas for angles. Then I select the one that I feel is the strongest, and reshape my post around it.</p>
<p>It may sound like double-handling, but the way I see it, I&#8217;ll have to edit the post anyway, so the review is no big deal. Also, the hook I choose is usually the one that&#8217;s been made clearest by the content I&#8217;ve written, so the post usually already leans in the direction in which I want to take it.</p>
<p>As I write this post, it&#8217;s now that I&#8217;m beginning to think, &#8220;Okay, I know what I&#8217;ve said here. What angles can I see?&#8221; I&#8217;ve got three options in this list, so I could use the number three in my title. I&#8217;ve also talked a lot about hooks and frames; I could pick up on that theme in my title, calling the piece something like &#8220;How an Article Frame Gives Readers a Clearer Picture&#8221;. That works well with the picture reference I used in the post&#8217;s opening. I&#8217;ve used the word &#8220;context&#8221; a lot, but it&#8217;d be easy to change those references to &#8220;frame&#8221; to fit this angle.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I could work with the hook angle, changing my opening to talk about grabbing readers&#8217; attention, and reeling them in with the bobbing lure of a promised post deliverable. I could call the article something like &#8220;Land Readers Like a Pro Using Catchy Article Hooks&#8221;.</p>
<p>Again, this is a fairly open-ended approach—the options are many, but because you already have your content drafted, they&#8217;re not quite as unlimited as they may seem when you&#8217;re starting with a headline or a broad topic. I find this approach gives a bit more direction than the others. That said, it&#8217;s important to take care to work your context into the post very well, so that it&#8217;s seamlessly integrated, and cohesive with the rest of the content you&#8217;ve prepared.</p>
<h2>Not just posts</h2>
<p>A content frame doesn&#8217;t have applications in posts or articles. You can just as easily and effectively use it to create a strong selling point for other information products: ebooks, reports, tutorial series, email newsletters, and so on.</p>
<p>Examples? <em>31 Days to Build a Better Blog</em> is a great one. This content could simply have been pitched to readers as a list of essential tips, or master-blogger&#8217;s secrets. But as concepts that clearly identify reader deliverables, those options are pretty hazy.</p>
<p><em>31 Days to Build a Better Blog</em>, on the other hand, says what the reader will get. The content is structured accordingly. Readers know what to expect, and they receive it. That leads to customer satisfaction, and builds Darren&#8217;s reputation for honesty and integrity in the process.</p>
<p>See how beneficial a good frame can be for matching your content to your readers? How serious are you about framing your content? Do you do it often? What tips can you share?</p>

<h2>What? Another blog? Are you crazy?</h2>
<p>One of the most common reactions I get when I mention that I&#8217;m starting a new blog is something along the lines of, &#8220;How are you going to fit that in?&#8221;</p>
<p>Two months ago I wrote about the process I&#8217;d gone through to <a href="http://www.problogger.net/archives/2010/09/24/please-welcome-georgina-probloggers-new-content-manager/">hire Georgina Laidlaw to work on content development and strategy for me</a>. One of the reasons I expanded my team in this way was to create for myself some head space to dream and develop new projects.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve already seen some of these rolled out (the Free <a href="http://courses.sitepoint.com/gettingstartedblogging">Getting Started Blogging course</a> (with over 5000 participants already) and the soon-to-be-released <a href="http://www.probloggeracademy.com">ProBlogger Academy</a>).</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how much I&#8217;ve enjoyed having a little extra head space over the last month to dream. It&#8217;s led to all kinds of ideas, collaborations, and opportunities (as well as a little more life balance). It&#8217;s been one of the best things I&#8217;ve done in the last few years of blogging.</p>
<p>Another long-term goal that I&#8217;ve had is to run a blog on a much wider niche than my previous blogging endeavors. FeelGooder is that blog.</p>
<h2>What is FeelGooder?</h2>
<p>Let me start by saying that what you see of FeelGooder today is very much a stage one of where I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll go. I&#8217;ve described what we&#8217;ve done so far as a &#8220;soft launch&#8221; but perhaps a better description would be that it&#8217;s FeelGooder v0.1 (beta), and that my hope is for it to expand well beyond what you see on it today.</p>
<p>As I describe in the <a href="http://www.feelgooder.com/welcome-to-feelgooder/">Welcome to FeelGooder post</a> a couple of days ago, the blog&#8217;s focus is pretty wide. In some ways it&#8217;s niche is Life (how much broader could you get?). It&#8217;s a bit of a departure from my previous blogs, which were quite focused (on topics like <a href="http://www.problogger.net/">Blog Tips</a>, <a href="http://www.digital-photography-school.com/">Photography</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitip.com">Twitter</a>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m under no allusions that such a broad niche will be easy, but this is something I&#8217;ve always wanted to do—partly because it connects with where I&#8217;m at personally, partly because of my own values and passions, and partly &#8230; just to see if I can pull it off.</p>
<p>The goal is to produce daily posts that are a mix of information (tips, guides, help), inspiration (stories, uplifting, and hope-filled articles), and interaction that will help people better experience the richness of their lives.</p>
<p>The blog will initially focus upon five topics:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: fitness, diet, emotional well being, and more</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong>: family, friendship, romance, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: careers, entrepreneurship, and developing skills for the workplace</li>
<li><strong>Finance</strong>: tips and stories to help look after the hip pocket</li>
<li><strong>Social Good</strong>: sustainable living, generosity, and making the world a better place.</li>
</ol>
<p>In time, these topics will expand (and I would like to see some of them splinter off into more targeted topics, too).</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the business model?</h2>
<p>Another departure for me with FeelGooder is that I&#8217;m launching it without any type of advertising. That&#8217;s not the model I want to use here (at least, not initially).</p>
<p>Long-term ProBlogger readers will know that my focus of late has moved a little to incorporate monetizing my blogs by developing my own products. I&#8217;m not giving the ad game away, but I see growing opportunities in the development of products (so far this has been around ebooks, courses, and membership sites).</p>
<p>FeelGooder is a bit of an experiment for me on this front, and I intend to develop a series of FeelGooder products to monetize the site. I&#8217;m not completely closed off to the idea of other forms of monetization (including advertising) down the track, but at least initially I&#8217;d like to experiment elsewhere.</p>
<p>Having said that, monetization is not my main focus at this point. My initial focus is more around:</p>
<ol>
<li>developing quality content</li>
<li>building an audience</li>
<li>building community.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my experience, monetization comes more easily once you&#8217;ve got those other three elements in place. So while I&#8217;m certainly thinking about monetization and the possibilities that might emerge there, I&#8217;m not currently putting a great deal of energy into that.</p>
<h2>What do you want to know?</h2>
<p>I hope that sharing some of the backstory behind this project has been of interest to you. Next week I&#8217;d like to continue looking at this case study by talking a little about some of the logistical elements of the site, including the design process, some of the thinking behind the editorial strategy, and some of the lessons I&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also be happy to answer as many other questions as I can about my strategy and the processes I&#8217;m going through with FeelGooder. So if you&#8217;ve got anything you&#8217;d like me to cover, please leave a comment below and I&#8217;ll attempt to get through as many of them as I possibly can.</p>

<p>Injecting a dose of Ajax into your WordPress-powered site is an excellent way to enhance functionality and streamline the user experience. Without touching a line of code, you can harness the power of Ajax to boost performance, improve usability, and fill your site with win.</p>
<p>Ajax enables your web pages to respond very quickly and smoothly to user input by loading only snippets of data instead of the entire page. The WordPress login/registration screen is a perfect example. Without Ajax, logging into the WordPress Admin requires a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> redirection and complete page load. With Ajax, users can log in from anywhere with no redirection or page load required. This translates into a more luxurious, sophisticated experience for you and your users.</p>
<p>Beyond the &#8220;coolness&#8221; factor, Ajax can also improve the responsiveness and performance of your site. Instead of loading new pages to leave comments, view posts, and share content, Ajax empowers users to interact with your site with greater intimacy and efficiency than ever before. By eliminating page loads, Ajax helps to save valuable server resources and bandwidth, resulting in improved performance for your site. And you can &#8220;ajaxify&#8221; just about anything: from logins and comments to navigation and updates, Ajax can speed things up, save resources, and make your site better than ever.</p>
<h2>WordPress + Ajax = Awesome</h2>
<p>Using WordPress, implementing Ajax functionality couldn&#8217;t be easier. By installing and configuring a few choice plugins, you can ajaxify your entire site (or any part of it) <em>without touching a single line of code</em>. The trick is choosing only the <em>best</em> plugins for your site, and only what&#8217;s needed. There are a zillion Ajax plugins available, but only a handful of them really work as advertised (or at all). Let&#8217;s check out some of the best WordPress plugins for adding Ajax to your site from within the comfort of the WordPress Admin.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#ajax-comments">Ajax plugins for WordPress comments</a></li>
<li><a href="#ajax-login">Ajax plugins for user login and registration</a></li>
<li><a href="#ajax-admin">Ajax plugins for the WordPress Admin area</a></li>
<li><a href="#ajax-others">Ajax plugins for other cool stuff</a></li>
<li><a href="#ajax-everything">Ajax plugins to ajaxify everything</a></li>
<li><a href="#ajax-seo">SEO considerations for ajaxed content</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ajax-comments">Ajax plugins for WordPress comments</h2>
<p>A majority of the <a title="Plugins tagged with 'Ajax'" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/ajax">Ajax plugins listed in the Plugin Directory</a> are aimed at improving the commenting system. Here are five of the best plug-n-play Ajax plugins for your WordPress comments area:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-comment-master/">WP-Comment-Master</a>: Put simply, <em>WP-Comment-Master</em> ajaxifies the entire commenting system: comment display, comment paging, comment submission, and posting. It features a great Settings page for easy integration and configuration and is definitely one of the best Ajax-comment plugins available.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/if-ajax-comments-for-wordpress/">iF AJAX Comments For WordPress</a>: Another excellent plugin for ajaxifying the comment-submission process. iF AJAX Comments enables users to preview and post their comments without refreshing the page. It includes a <em>ton</em> of options for fine-tuning required fields, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> styling, status messages, and more. It also features a host whitelist for tighter security.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-comment-page/">AJAX Comment Page</a>: AJAX Comment Page is a nice little plugin that ajaxifies the display of your comments with a fancy slide-in effect. It works great for paged or unpaged comments and includes a simple Settings page to control the number of comments per page.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-comment-preview/">Ajax Comment Preview</a>: So far, this is the best plugin I&#8217;ve found for <em>true</em> comment previews. Ajax Comment Preview enables your users to see <em>exactly</em> what their comments will look like when submitted. This plugin uses Ajax to send the preview through WordPress&#8217; &#8220;inner voodoo&#8221; and then instantly display the results. The plugin features a nice Settings page to control functionality and integrate the comment preview with your design.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/report-comments/">AJAX Report Comments</a>: One of my favorite Ajax plugins, Ajax Report Comments enables your visitors to report inappropriate comments with a single click. The Admin page includes basic settings and an email template. This plugin offers truly tight functionality and amust-have for sites with tons of user comments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ajax-login">Ajax plugins for user login and registration</h2>
<p>Ajax can literally revolutionize the user login/registration/lost-password experience. Instead of requiring multiple clicks and page loads to log into the Admin, here are three plugins that ajaxify the entire process into a single click.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/login-with-ajax/">Login With Ajax</a>: Login With Ajax is a popular, well-ranked plugin (it has over 45K downloads). It enables users to log in, register, and recover lost passwords from the sidebar (via widget) or anywhere in your theme (via the <code>login_with_ajax()</code> template tag). It features a great Settings page with role-specific redirects and custom registration email templates.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/iredlof-ajax-login-plugin/">iRedlof Ajax Login</a>: Much more than a login widget, iRedlof Ajax Login adds a complete user dashboard to the top of the screen. The dashboard is pre-styled and includes complete login functionality as well as links to random posts and admin menus personalized to each user according to their role. Downsides: there&#8217;s no Settings page, and you need to add <code>updateHeader()</code> to your theme template.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-login-widget/">AJAX Login Widget++</a>:  Another good plugin for Ajax-powered login, registration, and password functionality, this one also features login redirect. The login form can be placed in your sidebar with a widget, or anywhere else with <code>add_ajax_login_widget()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ajax-admin">Ajax plugins for the WordPress Admin area</h2>
<p>On the other side of WordPress, the Admin area is another excellent place to enjoy the smooth and sophisticated comforts of Ajax. Unfortunately there aren&#8217;t quite as many Ajax-based Admin plugins to choose from, but here two that are both fun and useful.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-plugin-helper/">Ajax Plugin Helper</a>: It&#8217;s simple: save time while keeping up with WordPress plugin updates. Ajax Plugin Helper lets you activate, deactivate, delete, and upgrade plugins without leaving the Plugins page. Very smooth stuff, and there&#8217;s even an &#8220;Upgrade All&#8221; feature for knocking out multiple upgrades with a single click! Nice.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-ajax-note/">Admin Ajax Note</a>: Ever wish you could leave notes and stuff for other admin users? Admin Ajax Note makes it easy with an Ajax-powered notepad in the upper-right corner of the Admin area. Create, edit, and delete as many notes as you want, and share with all users, one user, or none. Good stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two plugins are great, but it would awesome to add more to the list. If you know of any sweet Ajax Admin plugins, please share them in the comments!</p>
<h2 id="ajax-others">Ajax plugins for other cool stuff</h2>
<p>Here are some other keen plugins for ajaxifying different parts of your WordPress site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/dynamicwp-contact-form/">DynamicWP Contact Form</a>: The DynamicWP Contact Form puts a floating Contact button on the upper-left side of the page. Click the button and the dynamic contact form slides into view. Messages are sent via Ajax to keep the user on the same page throughout the process. Snazzy indeed, but the styling is distinct and may need to be tweaked to fit your design.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-calendar/">AJAX Calendar</a>: An ajaxified version of the classic WordPress calendar, AJAX Calendar enables you to browse the months without reloading the page. It features a link to display all posts for the current month, as well as a caching option to enhance performance. If you&#8217;re already using the classic WP calendar, this plugin is highly recommended.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-category-posts-dropdown/">Ajax Category Posts Dropdown</a>: This plugin is perfect for sites with lots of subcategories. Ajax Category Posts Dropdown lists your categories in a dropdown box. When a user clicks on a category, all posts from that category are displayed via Ajax. Easily display the list in your sidebar via widget, or anywhere in your theme via the <code>acpd_display($acdp_title)</code> template tag.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ajax-everything">Ajax plugins to ajaxify everything</h2>
<p>One of the coolest things to ajaxify is your WordPress navigation, so that when users click to the next post, it&#8217;s loaded instantly and on the same page, without a reload. Here are two awesome plugins that use Ajax to load posts, pages, comments, and archives to basically ajaxify all default functionality on the public side of your WordPress site.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajax-for-all/">Ajax For All</a> [<a href="http://ajax.nkuttler.de/">Demo</a>]</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajaxd-wordpress/">AJAXed WordPress</a> [<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ajaxd-wordpress/screenshots/">Screenshots</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>As with any plugin that greatly modifies WordPress, these plugins involve a lot of options. You&#8217;ll need to spend some time to understand and configure them properly. Most of the other plugins mentioned so far are plug-n-play, but Ajax-everything plugins like these require some time to familiarize and customize.</p>
<h2 id="ajax-seo">SEO considerations for ajaxed content</h2>
<p>As you ajaxify your site, keep in mind that search engines aren&#8217;t yet crawling or indexing ajaxed data, so make sure you&#8217;re enabling Google et al to find your content. There are numerous solutions to this challenge, the easiest of which involves the use of a well-linked sitemap and actual <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> content delivered via <code>noscript</code> tags.</p>
<p>Also consider <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> when ajaxifying your comments. User comments add content to your web pages, but they won&#8217;t be crawled, indexed, or considered in page rank if they&#8217;re served with Ajax. For many sites, this shouldn&#8217;t be too big a deal, but it is something to think about.</p>
<p>For more information on Ajax and <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, check out Scott Allen&#8217;s article, <a href="http://www.hybrid6.com/webgeek/2007/01/ajax-web-20-and-seo.php">AJAX, Web 2.0 and SEO</a>.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>These are the Ajax gems that I&#8217;ve managed to find, but many other great plugins are available. If you know of any good WordPress Ajax plugins (or themes!), please share them in the comments. Thanks!</p>

<p>Those who read ProBlogger on an iPhone, Android phone, Palm, or Blackberry Storm will know that you&#8217;re given the option to view this blog within a theme designed for mobile devices. I use <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com/products/wptouch-pro/?wptouch_affiliate_id=5221&amp;utm_source=affiliate-5221&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=text1">WPTouch</a> to serve this up—it&#8217;s a WordPress plugin that I&#8217;ve found incredibly easy to use. I have it installed both here on ProBlogger and on <a href="http://www.digital-photography-school.com">Digital Photography School.</a></p>
<p>I had to switch it off recently while making some server changes, and I was amazed how many complaints I received. It seems a lot of readers these days read my blogs on mobile devices!</p>
<p>WPTouch offers a lot of great features that I won&#8217;t go into here, except to say that it lets you customize your display far beyond what I&#8217;ve done to date.</p>
<p>One feature that I will mention quickly is that the plugin offers those who view your blog on an iPhone a way to actually add a web app to their iPhone homescreen. This will increase the number of people checking out your blog on mobile devices.</p>
<p>One of the other great features WPTouch offers is the ability to monetize your mobile theme with advertising. Once you&#8217;ve got it installed on your WordPress blog, all you need is to open up the WPtouch area, and look for the Advertising tab.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wptouch-advertising.png" alt="wptouch-advertising.png" width="540" height="235" /></p>
<p>In this view, you can select a variety of options. You can see here that I&#8217;m testing AdSense, and that I&#8217;ve put the ads below the header (you can also put them in the footer), and that I can select a variety of positions for them.</p>
<p>I did try the ads in the footer area initially, but they end up so far down the page that I doubted they&#8217;d ever be seen (note: it&#8217;d be good to have the option to display ads in the header and footer).</p>
<p>The ads are not the prettiest in the world, but here&#8217;s how they look on both the home page of the theme, and in individual posts.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wp-touch-ads.png" alt="wp-touch-ads.png" width="540" height="403" /></p>
<p>The ad position is prominent, yet they don&#8217;t completely take over the page, and the ads are contextual—all a good recipe for performance (at least, it is in theory).</p>
<p>WPTouch also gives you a way to use <a href="http://www.admob.com/">AdMob</a> ads on your blog, or even to show custom ads (so you could advertise your own products or sell ads directly to advertisers—something I&#8217;m yet to test.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had these ads working on the ProBlogger and dPS mobile sites for a few days now, and the signs are promising. Obviously their success on your site will depend a lot on how many readers you have and how many of them are reading your blog on a mobile device. However, already I&#8217;ve seen my ads earning more for each day of my test than I&#8217;m earning through RSS ads with AdSense.</p>
<p>In fact, the eCPM that I&#8217;m seeing is around five to six times what AdSense earns on normal ads on my pages. While the actual traffic numbers to my mobile site aren&#8217;t as high as traffic to the blog via computers, I&#8217;m excited to see the potential of this tool.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m averaging around $30 per day so far in earnings from mobile visitors, so the <a href="http://www.bravenewcode.com/products/wptouch-pro/?wptouch_affiliate_id=5221&amp;utm_source=affiliate-5221&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=text1">WPTouch</a> plugin paid for itself in 24 hours. While that revenue figure isn&#8217;t huge in comparison to other earnings on my blogs, it adds up to over $10,000 a year. That&#8217;s $10,000 which was gained simply by installing a plugin and adding my AdSense account—certainly some low-hanging fruit that I&#8217;ve been overlooking.</p>

<p>Ever since I read Chris Guillebeau’s manifesto, <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/overnight-success/" target="_blank">279 Days to Overnight Success</a>, I’ve been inspired to create one for my own blog. The way that it communicated the message of his blog, packaged in an attractive, shareable, valuable asset that cemented his place as a niche leader, was enough to make this blogger gush.</p>
<p>After nine months of blogging I decided to create <a href="http://www.womeninbusiness.com.au/_blog/Style_and_Substance/post/manifesto" target="_blank">a manifesto for my blog</a>. I can honestly say it was one of the best things I’ve done.</p>
<p>It’s helped me:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicate the purpose and mission of my blog (which has helped keep my posts consistent in their message)</li>
<li>attracted the &#8220;right&#8221; people</li>
<li>built community and solidarity with those &#8220;right&#8221; people</li>
<li>spread my message to the networks of &#8220;right&#8221; people, attracting them to my blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s been blogged, shared, tweeted, emailed, and printed out. I’ve received emails of thanks, one woman wrote to tell me she had printed it out and given it as a gift to her (all female) staff.</p>
<p>So, what exactly are blog manifestos, and should you create one for your blog?</p>
<h2>What is a manifesto?</h2>
<p>A manifesto traditionally communicates the values and beliefs of a group of people or organization. The most common form of blog manifestos are ebooks.</p>
<p>A manifesto that offers special value for your readers can act as a viral marketing tool for your blog. It gives the reader an idea of the bigger picture and purpose of your blog, and empowers them.</p>
<p>A manifesto is a method of structuring your message in a way that your audience finds relatable, desirable and, most importantly, attainable. It communicates a set of ideals and invites a reader to join you on your journey.</p>
<h2>How to create your own blog manifesto</h2>
<p>Like any trend, the more popular manifestos get, the harder it is to break through the noise. Look to see what’s being produced in your niche and do something different. Be original: think about what your particular audience wants, needs, and will find irresistible.</p>
<p>I created my manifesto as a one-page poster designed to be printed and stuck to a wall. Find the best way to communicate your message to your audience. It doesn’t have to be an ebook. It doesn’t have to be a long story. It just has to have impact.</p>
<p>Give your manifesto away freely—you want it to spread. You also want it to be linked to your blog, so brand it strongly, but not obtrusively.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about your own assets when promoting your manifesto. Link to it from your email signature, add it to your navigation bar and your mailing list welcome email, and blog and tweet about it.</p>
<h2>What’s your message?</h2>
<p>Here’s the catch; you need a strong message before you even think about creating a manifesto.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, taking the time to think about your message will improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>your branding</li>
<li>how your audience relates to you</li>
<li>your value offer and niche positioning with your readers</li>
<li>your editorial direction and overall purpose</li>
</ul>
<p>So my question to you is: what’s your message? How does your message help your readers? What’s going to make them share your message with their network?</p>

Curious? So are we!</em></p>
<p>What impact will changes to the flow of communications on the Internet cause by the rise of new options, like social media, have on the old marketing adage, &#8220;the money’s in the list&#8221;? I was asked this recently, and I’ve been pondering the question ever since.</p>
<p>For quite some time, in all honestly, I dismissed the question, because I’ve literally made millions of dollars through email marketing—I’d be hard pressed to ignore that.</p>
<p>But then I thought about the main reasons I’ve been able to use that communication method as a monetization tool. The answer? It’s about the connection, not the practical outcome of having someone’s email address.</p>
<p>Then I realized that the money is not in the list, it’s in the connection with a customer.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t fear the changes new communications methods have brought to bear. We should see them as a great way to expand our channels to build even more connections with customers.</p>
<h2>The same principles apply</h2>
<p>It even gets better. You can take exactly the same approach you’ve been refining for your email list-building activity, and apply it to these new channels—the basic principles are exactly the same.</p>
<p>The four core attributes of successful email marketing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make your email capture findable.</li>
<li>Provide incentives for people to sign up.</li>
<li>Craft well-written, engaging messages.</li>
<li>Give more than you ask from your list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s look at how that might translate into a social media channel like Facebook.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Findable:</strong> Set up your vanity URL and Facebook page, and link to it from your site.</li>
<li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Offer something unique to your Facebook followers (a coupon or ebook, for example).</li>
<li><strong>Engage:</strong> Put together a publication schedule specifically for your Facebook page—don’t just syndicate your blog or Twitter feed.</li>
<li><strong>Promote:</strong> Seed your promotional messages with real value, quality content, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key here is to not treat the channel as a method to build your email list, but to see it as a new method to develop a connection with a customer in the place where they feel most comfortable communicating. If you’re trying to fit Facebook pegs into email holes, you might be able to jam a few in, but you’re costing yourself valuable leads in the process.</p>
<p>While these new channels need unique approaches, and different regulations govern what you can and can’t do in each, at their cores, they’re the same.</p>
<h2>Patience pays</h2>
<p>It took us all years to master the intricacies of marketing via email, so don’t expect instant income from these new channels. But stick with it, and you just might discover greater success was you step away from the norm and embrace new methods of connecting with your customers.</p>
<p>As long as the medium allows for me to communicate with my list, and my list to communicate with me, I’m happy.</p>

<p>I started <a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/">The Happiness Project</a> blog as a way to test the argument that novelty and challenge bring happiness (turns out they do!), but I knew nothing about blogging when I began.</p>
<p>Here are some strategies that I learned the hard way, through experience. As Benjamin Franklin once remarked, “Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.”</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start simple.</strong> Add bells and whistles over time. Many people get paralyzed at the outset, because they’re overwhelmed by the desire to figure everything out before launching. Don’t get it perfect, get it going.</li>
<li><strong>Post <em>every</em> day.</strong> It&#8217;s counter-intuitive, yes, but strangely it’s easier to post every day than to post three or four times a week. You don’t procrastinate, you loosen up, you stay engaged with your subject, and you’ll be taken more seriously by readers. But if you stop writing for a while…</li>
<li><strong>Don’t point out that you’ve been lax about posting!</strong> It’s boring, it shows a lack of commitment, and maybe readers won’t notice if you don’t say anything.</li>
<li><strong>Include the text of the post as well as the URL</strong> if you want to bring a post to someone’s attention by email. Often, people won’t bother to click through, even though they might like your post if they did!</li>
<li><strong>If you feel squeamish about posting something—don’t</strong>. Wait a day or two, and think it over.</li>
<li><strong>Join the community.</strong> Link to other bloggers who write about your subject, shine a spotlight on their work, get to know them. Blogland is a friendly, helpful place—and the truth about human nature is that people become interested in you when you show an interest in them.</li>
<li><strong>Read about blogging.</strong> My favorite resource is ProBlogger, of course.</li>
<li><strong>Use lists when possible.</strong> People love reading lists, especially tips lists. I know, tips lists seem like a simplistic way to present information. But people love them. I post a tips list every Wednesday.</li>
<li><strong>State the purpose of your blog very prominently.</strong> A new reader shouldn’t have to ask, “What’s this blog about, anyway?”</li>
<li><strong>Maintain quality.</strong> I have checklist to try to keep my posts interesting and my voice true:
<ul>
<li>Am I being funny?</li>
<li>Am I giving interesting information from science, history, literature, etc.?</li>
<li>Am I revealing my character?</li>
<li>Am I telling stories?</li>
<li>Am I showing what it’s like to live in New York City?</li>
<li>Am I linking to other bloggers?</li>
<li>Am I comfortable with my parents reading this? (I never work blue.)</li>
<li>Am I criticizing anyone except myself?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <strong>Keep a separate document containing your blog entries.</strong> I have an 800-page document containing every post I’ve ever made. That way, I can easily search, copy, and paste the material on my blog when I need it for other purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Keep a running list of ideas.</strong> Invaluable.</li>
<li><strong>Most important? Have something to say</strong> with every post, and with your entire blog. This sounds obvious, but it’s a lot easier to write when you’re trying to tell a story, explain an idea, give a review, link to an article, or whatever. If you’re having trouble with your blog, forget about the blog and focus on what you want to communicate instead.</li>

I talked about how developing your own products to sell to readers can be an effective way to build a blogging income.</p>
<p>During a question-and-answer segment of the presentation, one blogger stood up and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8220;My readers don&#8217;t want to buy products! How else can I make money?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a question that I&#8217;ve heard many bloggers ask over the last year—and one I used to ask myself. </p>
<p>I once was afraid that if I dared develop a product and promote it to my readers, they&#8217;d push back—and push back hard. However when I bit the bullet and did produce a product, I found that my fears were unfounded.</p>
<p>Readers buy all the time—we all do. We buy to survive, we buy be entertained, we buy to learn, and we buy to enjoy our lives.</p>
<p>I asked the blogger who asked this question what topic they blogged about, and she told me that she was a travel blogger. As a group, we quickly came up with 20 or so things that people interested in travel buy (guide books, luggage, accommodation, flights, and more). Her readers were buying products all the time—she just wasn&#8217;t offering any.</p>
<p>Readers do buy. Many even enjoy the process and go out of their way to be sold to. My lovely wife is one example: she amazes me with the amount of time she puts into researching and buying products online (she&#8217;s an online marketer&#8217;s dream come true!).</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t that blog readers don&#8217;t want to buy—they do!</p>
<p>What readers don&#8217;t want is to be annoyed.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.problogger.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/used-car-salesman.jpg" width="270" height="185" alt="used-car-salesman.jpg" style="float:right;" />In my experience, it&#8217;s not that you have a product to sell that turns readers off—it&#8217;s the way that you promote it that has potential to offend.</p>
<ul>
<li>Readers don&#8217;t like to be tricked.</li>
<li>Readers don&#8217;t like false hype.</li>
<li>Readers don&#8217;t like bait-and-switch tactics.</li>
<li>Readers don&#8217;t like finding that they&#8217;ve bought a low-quality product.</li>
<li>Readers don&#8217;t like aggressive and intrusive selling.</li>
<li>Readers don&#8217;t like being badgered and annoyed repetitively.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think many bloggers balk at the idea of developing a product to sell on their blogs more because they think that to sell, they&#8217;ll need to use the above tactics, and annoy their readers. We&#8217;re so used to seeing these techniques practiced by internet marketers that we think it&#8217;s the only way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>I love what <a href="http://www.remarkable-communication.com/">Sonia Simone</a> recently said in a presentation at Blog World Expo. She said, it&#8217;s not about &#8220;selling&#8221; to your readers—it&#8217;s about making them an offer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about tricking people—it&#8217;s about producing a compelling product that meets their needs and offering it to your readers in a way that represents a win/win transaction. It&#8217;s about making the offer in a way that allows your reader comes away from the interaction in a better position whether they buy the product or not.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s much that can be written about how to make these kinds of offers (and in many ways, that&#8217;s why we developed <a href="http://www.thirdtribemarketing.com/">Third Tribe Marketing</a>), however I think the starting point for many bloggers is shifting their mindset.</p>
<p>The starting point is to realize that in most cases is&#8217;t not buying that offends people—it&#8217;s the sales techniques that annoy.</p>

<p>So you want to be a travel writer? So do a lot of people. In fact, I can’t think of one person who wouldn’t love to get paid to travel.  To try, lots of people start travel blogs. Some just do it for fun; others do it seriously. Some would like to get paid but can’t be bothered to really put in the time, so the few hundred they make off advertising is enough for them.</p>
<p>In 2008, when I started my travel blog, I could count the number of travel blogs on one hand. Now, there are hundreds upon hundreds: it’s a cluttered field. So how can you create a successful travel blog that moves beyond the clutter, gets you noticed, and helps fund your travels? Here are my top seven tips.</p>
<h2>1. Be an expert.</h2>
<p>The best travels blogs are written by people who have traveled, or are traveling. No one wants to take travel advice from someone who doesn’t travel. Many travel bloggers start blogging months before they actually start traveling. But the casual readers you want to attract want tried and tested travel advice. They want an expert—someone with experience. It’s simple advice, but it’s so often overlooked. People who start a blog six months before their trip and realize they don’t have content either stray off their subject, or commit the next sin…</p>
<h2>2. Skip the generic advice.</h2>
<p>One of the mistakes most beginner travel bloggers make is that they write generic articles. They make lists of what to pack, lists of how to pack, posts on how to find a cheap flight, or other topics every traveler should know. Google any of these terms and you’ll find millions of results.</p>
<p>When I first started out, I did this too, but in order to be successful, you need to differentiate yourself.  Yes, these tips are important and I have a special section on my site for beginner tips (after all, beginners need them). But they don’t retain readers over the long term. You need to be different.</p>
<p>What advice can you offer that no one else can? What experience can you impart?  For example, I talk about money a lot. I talk about how to use frequent flier programs for free flights and find unadvertised deals. I break it down. I show you, rather than telling you. I don’t tell you what to pack. I tell you where to go and how to save when you’re there.  Forget about an article called, “10 Things to See in London.” Instead, write a piece titled, “A Historical Walk Through London’s WW2.”  Tell people information that can’t easily find—take them off the beaten track.</p>
<h2>3. Be a good writer.</h2>
<p>Travel is about a telling a story. You want to bring someone else on the journey. Travel isn’t about you: it’s about your reader. In telling a travel story, you are putting the reader in the picture, connecting them to that place and time. You don’t need to be Ernest Hemmingway or Bill Bryson, but you can’t just blog about what you did on Sunday.</p>
<p>A good travel blog tells a story that brings people to the place. Most people won’t end up going to that location, but what keep readers coming back to your blog is telling a story that your reader can relate to. For example, my post on <a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/the-island-of-ios/">making friends in Ios</a> is about Ios but it’s really about connecting with people. That’s something everyone can relate to. My <a href="http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/my-own-private-budapest/">post on Budapest</a> describes good things to see in Budapest, but also talks about the joy of enjoying understanding local culture.  Write a story that connects with your reader.</p>
<h2>4. Be a personality.</h2>
<p>When you think of ProBlogger, you think of Darren Rowse. The Four Hour Week? Tim Ferris.  SEOmoz? Rand Fish. When we think of big sites, we think of the personalities behind them—their creators. They are the personality, and we identify the brand with them.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be a successful travel blogger, you need to be a personality. You need to be out there dominating a certain travel niche. Be the best backpacker blogger, be the best boomer blogger, or the best family travel blogger out there. This means having a voice on Twitter, having personality in your posts, and relating to people. You are the voice. And people are going to follow you because they have a vested interest in your life and your travels.</p>
<h2>5. Or don’t.</h2>
<p>If you don’t want to be a personality or deal with social media, and you just want to relax, another way to make a successful travel site is to create destination-specific blog.  Destination-specific websites rely on SEO. These sites are a bit less work and can bring in a lot of money, but you’ll never be a “name.”</p>
<p>Sites like <a href="http://www.travelfish.org/">Travel Fish</a> and <a href="http://www.bootsnall.com/">Boots N’ All</a> are very good, have a lot of traffic, and make a lot money—but could you name the person behind them? Most can’t. Probably most people in the travel industry can’t either. But creating a destination website is your best alternative to creating a travel blog, where you need to be a personality. All you need to do is focus on some juicy keywords, and yours can be the number one site on Mexico.</p>
<h2>6. Use photos.</h2>
<p>Most people don’t travel all the time. However, we all love seeing beautiful places we’ll never visit. That’s we all had tropical island posters back in college, and calendars in our cubicle. It’s why we love <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/">The Big Picture from Boston.com</a>. How many of you have really read <em>National Geographic</em>? Mostly we just look at the pretty pictures.</p>
<p>People simply love good photos. So have big photos that attract the eyes. You can write a great story, but without images, you won’t get a lot of return visitors. I would love to hear about your safari. But you know what I would love more? Huge pictures of the Serengeti, lions, elephants, and gazelles. Travel is as much about photography as it is about writing.</p>
<h2>7. Stay focused.</h2>
<p>Pick a niche and stick to it. Remember: you want to be an expert. No one wants to hear about backpacking from someone who takes cruises or women’s travel tips from a guy.  When you’re an expert in your niche, you attract traffic naturally because people always go to the best for information. You don’t buy books on physics from college students—you buy them from Stephen Hawking.</p>
<p>Don’t try to be everything to everyone. That’s the worst thing you can do in the travel niche. The world is a big place and there are simply too many ways to travel—you could never be good at covering them all with authority.  Just because you have a travel site doesn’t mean you should talk about all the forms of travel. Stick to what you know.</p>
<p>Travel is such a personal experience that you will turn people off quickly if they don’t think you actually know the location and type of travel you are talking about.  The good news? Travel is a big industry: you’re sure to find readers if you blog in this space.</p>

<p>Over the past four years, my business has completed over 500 custom blog projects and through that experience, we&#8217;ve learned the ins and outs of a what contributes to a successful blog design.</p>
<p>Today, I wanted to share the five key factors I believe you should consider before hiring a blog designer. Thinking about these five factors in advance will help you make the most of your experience.</p>
<h2>1. What are your goals for the project?</h2>
<p>This sounds like an obvious question, but being able to communicate clearly your reasons for wanting a blog design will be extremely helpful for your designer, and will contribute to a more successful project.</p>
<p>I recommend having one or two main goals or objectives. Then, if necessary, create a subset of several more. For example, when I ask potential clients what their goals are for their projects, it isn&#8217;t usual for the blogger to respond with a really abstract answer: &#8220;I want my blog to look better,&#8221; or &#8220;I want my blog to be more visible.&#8221; Neither of these goals are specific enough to help us create a great blog design, so it&#8217;s my job to ask more specific questions at that point.</p>
<p>Get a head start by really thinking about what your goals are for the blog design. If it&#8217;s a new blog, you may have specific goals around branding either yourself or your blog business. If you&#8217;re redesigning an existing blog, you may have goals such as increasing the number of daily opt-ins to your email list, or changing the layout so your visitors are able to read the content they want more easily.</p>
<p>Again, the more specific you can be with your goals, the more successful your project is going to be.</p>
<h2>2. Which sites do you like? What do you like about them?</h2>
<p>Having a list of sites and blogs that you like and can reference is a huge help to your designer. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to have examples of sites that you want to copy, or sites that you like everything about—actually, the contrary is true. The best thing to do is gather sites that you like specific elements of. For example, you could really like the header of one site, the color scheme of another site, and the footer of yet another site.</p>
<p>I recommend having a list of at least three to five sites that you like. As with my first point, the more specific you are with what you like about the sites, the better. If you like the header of a site, think about what it is that you like about the header. There are usually multiple elements within the header of the site; you may like the position of the logo, or the way the navigation looks, or where the RSS icon is located, or that it&#8217;s tilted sideways, and so on.</p>
<h2>3. What&#8217;s your budget?</h2>
<p>Have a budget in mind for your project—this may determine who you hire. There are many possibilities for designing a blog interface, and a wide range of pricing options.</p>
<p>The least expensive option is to go with a premium WordPress theme that closely suits your needs. Expect to pay in the range of $50-$150 USD. For improved branding, you can also have a custom logo designed, which will usually cost you around $300 USD.</p>
<p>There are other options, such as <a href="http://99designs.com">99designs.com</a>, that can be less expensive than engaging a design agency or even a well-known freelance designer. The upside is that you&#8217;ll get good value for your money, but you will also have to put a lot more effort into preparing a great design brief, creating a layout description, and giving feedback on designs. A reasonable price to pay on 99designs for a custom blog design is around $1100 USD.</p>
<p>Going with a custom design firm or a well-known freelancer is going to be more expensive, but you will have the experience of working with a professional, and can expect customer service to be top notch. I would recommend speaking with at least three different agencies or designers before you select one. This way, you&#8217;ll get to know the process, get an idea of what they charge, and have a feel for who understands your needs and who doesn&#8217;t. For a professional custom blog design, I&#8217;d expect to pay a minimum of $3,500—more likely, closer to $5,000 USD.</p>
<h2>4. What&#8217;s your timeline?</h2>
<p>The timeline for the creation of a custom blog design comes down the schedule of the person or company doing the creative work. Designers usually have lead times of at least a couple weeks for starting new projects. For example, we estimate that a custom WordPress blog will usually take eight to 12 weeks from start to finish. If you need it quicker than that, you can expect to pay extra for rush delivery.</p>
<p>Some individual freelancers may be able to complete a project faster, and options like 99designs.com can also be quicker. The best advice here is to plan as far in advance as possible, get multiple quotes, and choose the one that works for your timeline.</p>
<h2>5. Which sites has the designer created that you like?</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that you have selected several possible designers for your project, and that you&#8217;ve selected them at least in part because of their past work. It&#8217;s important that you can identify which sites they&#8217;ve done that you like, and what you like about them, for referencing purposes when you are speaking with the designer.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Whichever route you choose to go through—agency, freelancer, 99designs.com—just remember that the more thought and work you put into the project before approaching designers, the more successful your project is going to be. Getting a custom blog designed can be a headache or a great experience, but fortunately you can do a lot to influence which way the project goes.</p>
