It seems that, almost no matter what the content, some part of the audience complains that it isn't advanced enough. This is clearly an industry-wide struggle &ndash; we even have conferences now with &quot;Advanced&quot; right in the name.</p>
<p>The problem is that &quot;advanced&quot; means a lot of things to a lot of people. Some of those meanings are useful and can inform our future efforts, but some are closer to myth than reality.</p>
<p><h2><strong>1. &quot;Advanced&quot; Means Secrets</strong></h2>
<p>Let's start with one that's closer to myth. To some, especially people who are new to SEO, &quot;advanced&quot; means giving away the secret sauce. They naturally assume that we SEOs are saving the best stuff for ourselves or will only part with it if the price is right. Unfortunately, the snake-oil side of the industry does its best to perpetuate that myth.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've gotten to know and have access to some pretty amazing search marketers. It's true, on the one hand, that there are bits of information they don't share with everyone. In most cases, though, those &quot;secrets&quot; are either short-lived (Google catches on), fit a very narrow niche, or are just high-level tactics that still require a lot of time and effort. I've never once heard a secret that would magically propel a site to the top of the rankings with no work.</p>
<p><h2><strong>2. &quot;Advanced&quot; Means New</strong></h2>
<p>Sometimes, &quot;advanced&quot; just means new or cutting-edge. Google's algorithm changed more than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_jm_isupFY">300 times</a> last year, so keeping up with the latest can be important, and it certainly takes an advanced SEO (or, at least, a full-time one) to keep up with all the news. On the other hand, only a fraction of those changes really impact most people, so whether it's important to always have that news instantly is open for debate.</p>
<p><h2><strong>3. &quot;Advanced&quot; Means New to Me</strong></h2>
<p>Of course, &quot;new&quot; is a bit subjective. Even the TV tells us: &quot;if you haven't seen it, it's new to you.&quot; In SEO, that could mean content you simply haven't seen before, or it could mean a content niche that's complementary to SEO but isn't discussed as often. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is a good example &ndash; it's relevant and interesting to search marketers. On the other hand, as someone who participates actively in the CRO space, I'm often amazed at what passes for &quot;advanced&quot; with an SEO audience. I have to step back and realize that, just because I see that content ever day, our readers don't. So, it's new (and useful) to some of you.</p>
<p><h2><strong>4. &quot;Advanced&quot; Means Technical</strong></h2>
<p>If you like to get your hands dirty, you may think &quot;advanced&quot; means deeply technical tips, complete with spreadsheets, plug-ins, and code. It's true that a lot of advanced tactics do require a deeper understanding of the technical side of SEO, but it's often a challenge to cover that kind of content in a blog post or conference session. Either you can't quite do it justice, or the topic becomes so niche that it only applies to a small segment of the audience. When you serve a wide demographic, this can be challenging, to say the least.</p>
<p><h2><strong>5. &quot;Advanced&quot; Means Enterprise</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, some people equate &quot;advanced&quot; with large-scale, enterprise SEO. Like the technical side, there's certainly some validity to that idea. Sites with 100,000+ pages definitely have unique problems, and the scale can turn even sometimes simple issues (like duplicate content) complex fast. Like deeply technical SEO, the challenge here is that any given solution or discussion probably only applies to a fairly small number of sites, at least once you dig into the details.</p>
<p><h2><strong>What Does &quot;Advanced&quot; Mean To You?</strong></h2>
<p>Of course, these are just a few examples, and each of them can be split apart even more. Here's where I'd like to hear from you. What do you think &quot;advanced&quot; SEO is, and, in a perfect world, how would you want search blogs and conferences to cover advanced topics?

In the answers, you'll also see citations to sources for the answers.</p> <ol>     <li><strong>Which is more likely to have a positive impact on a page's search engine rankings and why - 10 links from 1 website or 1 link each from 10 different websites?</strong><br /> <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span><br />All other things being equal, there appears to be a very strong correlation between higher rankings and a diversity of linking domains. Hence, earning 10 links from 10 unique sites should provide greater benefit. My opinion is that Google rewards this type of linking because diversity indicates both broad popularity/importance and greater editorial citation vs. a single site (possibly one which has a relationship with the linked site). The larger quantity of linking domains is also a far greater barrier for marketers and businesses to earn vs. the single site's links.<br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span><br />(References: <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/google-vs-bing-correlation-analysis-of-ranking-elements">Correlation of Rankings</a>, <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/10-illustrations-on-search-engines-valuation-of-links">All Links are Not Created Equal</a>)<br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li><li><strong>Explain the difference between the following items and how the search engines treat them - 301 response code, 302 response code, canonical URL tag and meta refresh.</strong><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span><br />A 301 redirect tells browsers and search engines that a page has been permanently redirected to a new URL. A 302 redirect indicates a temporary redirection that will change again or revert back in the future. Search engines such as Google and Bing interpret a 301 redirect by passing the link equity and ranking metrics from the 301'd URL to the target page. 302 redirects do not always receive this treatment (though exceptions exist) and may show in the search results with the original URL/snippet even after the 302 redirect is in place.<br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span><br />The Canonical URL tag is a &lt; link rel&gt; item in the header of a document that serves as a suggestion to search engines, indicating the &quot;original&quot; or &quot;canonical&quot; version of that page's content.

The most obvious and direct is the potential for creation of links and references to the sites/pages that garner traffic and attention through social media. Another powerful influence is the use of social results directly in SERPs as seen by Google &amp; Bing's integrations with Twitter (and Bing's integration with Facebook). Google also has connections, often via Gmail and other services to &quot;results from my social circle&quot; which can bring results to page 1 that otherwise wouldn't appear). There's also indications that tweets, in particular, may be directly influencing rankings and being treated as links, particularly for queries that call the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-query-deserves-freshness">QDF algorithm</a>. Finally, brand associations and mentions may be mined by the engines from social sources and used in brand entities or co-citation algorithms to help a site/page be seen as more relevant or related to particular keywords and more &quot;important&quot; or &quot;popular.&quot;<br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span><br />(References: <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6207/Use-Twitter-to-Rank-1-in-Google-in-Less-Than-Five-Minutes.aspx">Use Twitter to Rank in 5 Minutes</a>, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/googles_tweet-ranking_algorithm_rewards_popular.php">Google's Tweet Ranking Algorithm</a>, <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/13/facebook-bing-social-search/">Facebook + Bing's Plans to Make Search Social</a>, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-social-search-goes-live-adds-new-features-34487">Google Social Circle Goes Live</a>)<br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li><li><strong>List 5 tags/locations on a page where employing a target keyword can have a positive effect on search engine rankings.</strong><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span><br />Any of the following would be reasonable answers: Title element, domain name, subdomain, URL string, body element, alt attribute, bold/strong tag.<br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span><br />(References: <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/perfecting-keyword-targeting-on-page-optimization">Perfecting KW Targeting + On-Page Optimization</a>, <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/google-vs-bing-correlation-analysis-of-ranking-elements">Correlation of Google/Bing Rankings</a>, <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/googles-algorithm-pretty-charts-math-stuff">Explaining Google's Algorithm w/ Math</a>)&nbsp;<br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li><li><strong>Describe the distribution of search query demand and what is meant by the &quot;fat head&quot; and &quot;long tail.&quot;</strong><br /><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span><br />Billions of searches are performed each week, but the vast majority of these (~70%) are query terms/phrases that are searched for less than 10 times per month.

Many tens or hundreds of thousands of dimensions may be necessary to accurately represent a corpus' collection of &quot;topics&quot; and the words/phrases that are related.

We know it's mixed in with &quot;referring sites&quot; and &quot;direct traffic&quot; but luckily, there's a way to extract that data in just a few simple steps.</p> <h2><strong>Step 1: Create a Custom Segment</strong></h2> <p>Custom segments are the way to go for separating traffic into filter-able buckets for deeper analysis. GA makes this fairly painless:</p> <p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Step 1" width="450" height="234" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/ga-social-step-1.gif" /></p> <p>From any of the &quot;Traffic Sources&quot; sections, just click the &quot;Advanced Segments&quot; in the upper-right hand corner and then the link to &quot;Create a new advanced segment.&quot;</p> <h2><strong>Step 2: Add Social Sources</strong></h2> <p>This is the most crucial part, and requires that you have a full list of the sites/words to include. I don't recommend using just the domain names or URLs of the most popular social sites, but instead, some clever &quot;catch-all&quot; words using the &quot;source&quot; condition, as shown below:</p> <p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Step 2" width="610" height="351" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/ga-social-step-2.gif" /></p> <p>Make sure to continue adding &quot;OR&quot; statements, not &quot;and&quot; statements - the latter will require that both conditions are met vs. any one of the &quot;ORs&quot;. Here's the list of words I used, though you can certainly feel free to add to it:</p> <ul>     <li>twitter</li>     <li>tweet</li>     <li>facebook</li>     <li>linkedin</li>     <li>youtube</li>     <li>reddit</li>     <li>digg</li>     <li>delicious</li>     <li>stumbleupon</li>     <li>ycombinator</li>     <li>flickr</li>     <li>myspace</li>     <li>hootsuite</li>     <li>popurls</li>     <li>wikipedia</li> </ul> <p>Depending on your niche, it might be valuable to run through your top 2-500 referring domains looking for any obvious matches. You could also refer to Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites">list</a> of popular social sites.</p> <h2><strong>Step 3: Test &amp; Name Your Segment</strong></h2> <p>In order to create a fully functional segment, you'll want to test the logic you've created to be sure results are returning. Before you do that, though, GA requires naming your segment (I used &quot;social media&quot;):</p> <p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="Step 3" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/ga-social-step-3.gif" /></p> <p>Once it's complete and working properly, click &quot;save segment.&quot; You'll be returned to the prior screen with the segment ready to rumble.</p> <h2><strong>Step 4: Filter Traffic by &quot;Social Media&quot;</strong></h2> <p>Your new segment is ready to be applied. You can now filter social media exclusively or see it in comparison to other traffic sources on any report in GA. Just use the advanced segments drop-down and choose &quot;social media&quot; under the custom segments list like so:</p> <p style="text-align: center; "><img width="430" height="285" alt="" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/ga-step-4a.gif" /></p> <p>Of course, just having data is useless unless there's some action you can take from it. Segmenting social traffic is useful for reporting, particularly to gauge value (if you have action tracking on commercial activities set up in GA, for example) and see growth/impact over time. But, there's more you can learn than just raw traffic and conversions numbers.</p> <p>Here's some examples of reports I ran, along with the value/intelligence extracted from the data:</p> <p style="text-align: center; "><img width="620" height="553" alt="" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/ga-step-4b.gif" /></p> <p>It can be tough to &quot;see&quot; the social sites between other referring domains, but once they're broken out, combing through and finding the sites where your efforts are working is vastly more simple. If you then compare this against traffic &quot;opportunity&quot; from these sites (using a combination of traffic data and gut check), you'll be able to find which sites have the greatest chance to improve. For SEOmoz, Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit and Wikipedia stand out to me as places where we likely have more opportunity than we're currently capturing.</p> <p>This next chart compares search vs. social traffic over time:</p> <p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/ga-step-4c.gif" /></p> <p>If I'm looking to evaluate progress and make comparisons, this view is fairly useful. I can tell if my share of social media is growing or shrinking and how it compares to overall traffic and search individually. I'm only looking at a short timeframe here, but over the course of weeks or months, I can quickly gauge whether my efforts in social are paying off with traffic and whether they're improving my performance in search engines (through new links, citations, etc). When someone asks if social helps search, showing these two segments over time can be persuasive.</p> <p>Next, I'm reviewing the level of engagement of social media visitors:</p> <p style="text-align: center; "><img width="600" height="358" alt="" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/ga-step-4d.gif" /></p> <p>At first, I can compare this against other segments (like &quot;search&quot; or &quot;direct&quot;)&nbsp;as a measure of comparative value. But, I also want to compare this over time, particularly if I'm making tweaks to my site to encourage greater engagement and click-through to see if those efforts are successful.</p> <p>Just because I'm curious, I'll check out some browser stats:</p> <p style="text-align: center; "><img alt="" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/ga-step-4e.gif" />&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left; ">Admittedly, this isn't especially actionable, but it is fascinating to see the browser &quot;savvy&quot; of social users.

It's time to revisit that, as many of the answers have changed and the baseline has moved (forward).</p> <p>If you're in the SEO business professionally - either as an in-house marketer helping your team with SEO or as an SEO consultant (solo or agency), this knowledge should be second-nature. And if you're hiring a new SEO or seeking interview questions for someone to bring onto the team, feel free to use these to separate the wheat from the chaff:</p> <ol>     <li>Which is more likely to have a positive impact on a page's search engine rankings and why - 10 links from 1 website or 1 link each from 10 different websites?<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li>Explain the difference between the following items and how the search engines treat them - 301 response code, 302 response code, canonical URL tag and meta refresh.<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li>How can the meta robots tag impact how search engines crawl, index and display content on a web page?<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li>Who are the top 2 search engines (as ranked by share of queries) in the following countries - the United States, United Kingdom, Russia and China?<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li>Name at least 3 elements critical to ranking well in Google Local/Maps/Places search.<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li>What aspects of social media marketing have a positive impact on search engine rankings (apart from the value of direct links from the social sites)?<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li>List 5 tags/locations on a page where employing a target keyword can have a positive effect on search engine rankings.<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li>Describe the distribution of search query demand and what is meant by the &quot;fat head&quot; and &quot;long tail.&quot;<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li>Name 6 tools/sources that will display a list of external URLs that link to a webpage.<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li>What are some ways to positively influence the ratio of pages a search engine will crawl and index on a website?<br />     <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); ">_</span></li>     <li><strong>BONUS! </strong>Describe the concept of topic modeling and how modern search engines might use it to improve the quality of their results.</li> </ol> <p>I'll post answers to the questions in the next 12-24 hours and link to it from this post.

We have looked at a handful of tools here and will break them down one by one as to their strengths and weaknesses, as well as the validity and usefulness of the data provided. Ultimately we just wanted to share with you some other information sources out there that you can add to SEOmoz's list of tools that are great for competitor analysis (my personal favourites being the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/labs/lsvisualize">Linkscape Visualization and Comparison</a> tool as well as the <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/labs/link-intersect">Competitive Link Research</a> tool).<br /> <br /> However, I have had a number of clients asking me for a better view of overall market size and what kind of traffic their competitors are getting. Despite the fact that this has, unfortunately, at times meant crushing a few dreams about who a genuine/realistic competitor is or should be (i.e. NOT mashable if you are a new site) it can be tricky to find meaningful predictive data even when you know who your competitors are.</p> <h3><strong>The Failed Experiment</strong></h3> <p>Initially I wanted this to be an experiment testing out a number of services and running them against Analytics data to compare like for like and find which sites provided the most accurate information. I compiled Analytics data from 25 websites with hopes of comparing the real numbers (from Analytics) against the predictions of the other tools to try to find which was the most reliable across a number of sites from different sectors with a range of monthly traffic from ~1,000 monthly visitors to over 48,000,000 monthly visitors.<br /> <br /> The idea was to report on data across a number of these platforms for average monthly visits, total yearly visits, geographical visits and so forth. Unfortunately, there were many fewer tools that provided this data than I initially anticipated and it quickly became clear that we weren't going to be able to compare apples to apples and there is no substitute for internal data... but through the combination of some of the below tools you can get a good idea of what sort of traffic your competitors sites are getting.</p> <p>So, the experiment was a bit of a failure, but I learned more than my fair share about the tools so let's have a look at which tools are available and which tasks/comparisons they can be used for. I'm hanging on to all the data I collected and at a future date (if I ever hear back from some of the data sources) I will post a follow-up/re-do of the experiment.</p> <h3><strong>The Tool Belt</strong></h3> <p>It is worth pointing out that a number of these sites suggest they can provide better data if you claim the site(s) in question. I&nbsp;cannot testify to the accuracy of this because we have not looked into this (and could not feasibly claim the data for all 25 sites), also, all comments are based upon the free version of the tools as we did not have paid access to any of the tools.</p> <h2><strong>Alexa</strong></h2> <p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br /> <a href="http://www.alexa.com">Alexa</a> is good for comparing different sites traffic and for monitoring general traffic trends. It can be quite useful for comparing one site to a competitor site (up to 5 sites at a time). <br /> The index is massive and contains <em>some</em> data about all of the 25 sites we tested.</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br /> Not so great for the smaller sites. As you can see below, you won't get any of the traffic charts for sites ranked outside of the top 100,000 (which means if you Alexa thinks you are getting any fewer than 10,000 visits per month you're unlikely to glean any great information.</p> <p>Accuracy is a serious concern. This does taint the usefullness of the tool in general.</p> <p>The numbers reported are not helpful for predicting traffic on their own.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="550" height="218" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/alexa image.JPG" alt="" /></p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong></p> <p>We want to keep this all anonymous but let's just say one site that we  know gets 10-20,000 visits per month had an Alexa rank that was more  than 5 times better than a site that we know gets 75,000+ visitors per  month. And this was not just a one-off event.</p> <p>I would have to seriously quetsion the reliability of this tool. It didn't seem to be too bad at predicting the trends for a single site but the charts are extremely difficult to make any real use of. The information on bounce rate seems fairly accurate (give or take a few percent) but the trends for bounce rate seemed much less accurate (e.g. the ups and downs did not seem to correspond with similar peaks and valleys in Analytics).</p> <p>Perhaps most interestingly it seems to be skewed in favour of sites within the search marketing space. Sites in the search marketing space that we looked at regulary outranked sites receiving more than 10 times as much traffic on a monthly basis.</p> <p><strong>How to best use Alexa?</strong><br /> The tool is interesting for comparing similar sites or sites within an industry. I would like to recommend the tool but based upon my experience and this particular data set I would have to say I would be very cautious about using this to make any meaningful suggestions or estimates on traffic data. It is a great concept for a site but does not seem to have been particularly accurate.</p> <p>The most accurate data seemed to be the data from the visitors by country (the order was fairly accurate and the percentages we looked at were not to far off). To the extent that this data would be useful to have for your competitors this would be one good use of Alexa data.</p> <p>The insights for audience demographics could also potentially be extremely valuable, though accuracy will always be a question.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> <br /> Free. Options for site audits for $199<br /> &nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Compete</strong></h2> <p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br /> Useful interface.<br /> Speak the right language (unique visitors, visits, etc).<br /> Ability to compare multiple sites<br /> Data is easy to understand and well presented.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="550" height="190" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/compete chart.JPG" alt="" /></p> <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br /> Accuracy<br /> Somewhat limited number of sites - many sites that it classifies as &quot;low sample sites&quot;<br /> Cost of &quot;Pro&quot; option &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong><br /> Again, accuracy is a serious concern here. The data was off in some cases by as much as 2,000% for monthly visits. The accuracy seemed to be a bit better for the peaks in traffic and some of the general trends we looked at, but was certainly not reliable enough for us to suggest reporting competitor traffic based upon this information. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>How to best use Compete?</strong><br /> It should come as no surprise that <a href="http://www.compete.com/">Compete</a> is best used for comparing competitors. The scale of the data is way off but some of the trends seemed to be fairly reliable. I wouldn't advise reporting any numbers from this data (as they do not seem close/reliable at all - often off by a factor of 2 or more), however the trends are reliable. The information could be meaningfully used to look into seasonal trends between competitors. The demographic information (again, not being able to comment on the accuracy) would also be quite interesting but would require registering your site.<br /> <br /> I can't very well recommend the PRO services as I was not able to gain access and was unwilling to pay the cost just for the blog post. I would be extremely interesting in looking further into some of the referral data and the keywords data but this is not available as part of the standard free toolset.</p> <p><strong>Cost</strong>: Free. The PRO membership is $499 per month.<br /> &nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>ComScore</strong></h2> <p>Unfortunately we struggled with ComScore. We were unable to get a login or sneak a peak at any of the data. Thus, obviously we cannot comment on the validity of the data, only some of the offerings.</p> <p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br /> N/A</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br /> N/A</p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong><br /> N/A</p> <p><strong>Best use of ComScore:</strong><br /> ComScore offers a number of reports and insights into markets including reports on Local market size, as well as information about valuable/important keywords in an industry. It would be very interesting to find out where this data was coming from and how good it was, but we were not able to achieve this in time to publish this information.</p> <p>Cost: N/A<br /> Costs were not listed on the site, but rather suggest contacting ComScore directly.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Google Ad Planner</strong></h2> <p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br /> Sites also visited data is good<br /> Keywords searched for can be quite valuable<br /> Audience interests data interesting<br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br /> Accuracy<br /> Lack of data for small sites</p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong><br /> The accuracy was really mixed. For many of the sites <a href="http://www.google.com/adplanner">AdPlanner</a> provided much better data than some of the others, however, they were still off by miles for some sites - off by as much as 1000%. Again, the data on this in general tended to be better than many of the others, but given the occassional &quot;big miss&quot; I would not be comfortable using this data to make traffic predictions for a client.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="423" height="682" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/SEO moz ad planner.JPG" alt="" /></p> <p><strong>How to best use Google Ad Planner:</strong><br /> The data about other sites visited as well as keywords searched for (with affinity) could be extremely valuable. As well as some of the other metrics reported on and audience interests. However, the traffic data is not particularly meangingful and is not to be relied upon.</p> <p>Pro-tip: The data tends to be better when site owners have granted permission to analytics to publish data, I know we all love open and friendly, but this isn't the sort of thing you neccessarily want to make easier for your competitors to find.</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Google Insights<br /> </strong></h2> <p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br /> Trends around Keyphrases and keyphrase  groups<br /> Regional information<br /> Trusted source</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br /> Difficult to read the data<br /> No hard and fast numbers about traffic<br /> Hard to compare entire sites to one another</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="550" height="345" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/google insights snapshot.JPG" alt="" /></p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong><br /> You can bet that the accuracy of this data is going to be pretty good given that the data provider has access to more data than anyone else on the internet. However, the fact that the numbers are normalised and more designed for keyphrases and search terms and trends than for traffic data means that the search volume will correspond perfectly with the traffic to a site.</p> <p><strong>How to best use Google Insights:</strong><br /> <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/">Google Insights</a> could be quite helpful for finding the most valuable pockets of keyphrases and keyphrase groups. This could be particularly valuable when looking at a competitor site and trying to figure out which of their keyphrases are driving the most traffic. Further to that point, it could help you see which of the keyphrases within a keyphrase group might be the most valuable.</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>Free.<br /> &nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Google Trends for Websites</strong></h2> <p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br /> Good for illustrating magnitudes of difference between sites<br /> Allows comparison of multiple websites<br /> Includes regional information</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br /> Not good for comparing sites fairly similar in size<br />Does not have information for smaller sites when logged in<br /> Accuracy imperfect<br /> No numbers*</p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong><br /> The data seems to be more accurate when only trying to compare traffic from search, it does not seem to do as well in picking the winning recipient of overall traffic. Given that these trends are <a href="http://trends.google.com/websites?q=wikipedia.org">Google Trends</a> this is reasonable and still paints a fair landscape for an SEO's needs.</p> <p>When comparing websites with drastically different traffic numbers the rough visual estimation appears to correspond quite well with the observed analytics data as well.</p> <p>It's a shame there are no actual numbers for the data, but that would just be too easy.<br /> &nbsp;</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="550" height="188" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/Google Trends image.JPG" alt="" /></p> <p><strong>How to best use Google Trends for Websites?</strong><br /> Trends is great for broad information gathering. It gives some insite into similar searches when comparing sites, and in general it is unlikely that you will find better comparative data out there without direct access to your competitor's analytics account. However, Trends does not provide numbers and thus can only be used to venture a guess at what sorts of numbers competitors are pulling in.</p><p>When two sites are relatively similar in size Google Trends does not always pick the winner in terms of monthly traffic correctly. For example, one of the sites we tested received around 7.5m monthly visits whilst another received around 8m and Google ranked the 7.5m website higher. However, it is worth noting that the 7.5m visitor site received considerably more volume from search than did the 8m visitor site so from an SEO standpoint this data is probably quite accurate.</p><p><strong>Edit 22/11/2010 at 13:47 GMT:<br /><br /></strong>Thank you very much to <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/monitor-competitor-traffic#jtc126660">Jest for pointing out</a> that this information was originally written and summarised when logged out of Google. When visiting the site logged in it does provide data (i.e. numbers/ranges). This information makes the tool considerably more valuable. I&nbsp;must point out that I have not had time to run this across the entire data set, though it is worth pointing out that even with the information the data looks to be off on a few of the sites I&nbsp;have checked. It is not as far off as the data for the same sites using AdPlanner, but still considerably far off (e.g. reporting 140k visits for a site that receives ~320k unique visits daily).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>HitWise<br /> </strong></h2> <p>Unfortunately we were not able to get data from <a href="http://www.hitwise.com/us">HitWise</a> in time. The HitWise team was very helpful, responsive and agreeable and we will share this data once we have gotten our hands on it. However, we had not received the data back on the websites in the study in time for publication.</p> <p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br /> N/A</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br /> N/A</p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong><br /> N/A</p> <p><strong>Best use of HitWise:</strong><br /> HitWise, similarly to comScore works on a reporting basis insofar as you speak to them about the types of market reports you would like or you can create custom reports. Whilst we obviously cannot comment on the accuracy of the data the services offered look to be better tailored to an SEOs needs than do the reports offered by comScore. However, generally speaking HitWise will not work with agencies which will be a bit of a bummer for some of you.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free-$695+ per report<br /> The range in cost seems to be fairly large. Whether the data warrants the pricing structure cannot really be judged without looking at the data, though they do make some data freely available through their website.</p> <h2><strong>Quantcast<br /> </strong></h2> <p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br /> Traffic Numbers that are easy to follow<br /> Design and display of information<br /> Demographic information (when available)<br /> Media Planner Tool</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br /> Unreliable<br /> Lacks data for small-medium trafficked sites<br /> Accuracy<br /> Inability to compare sites</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="550" height="217" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/quantcast unable.JPG" alt="" /></p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong><br /> Definitely the biggest shortcoming of the <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/">Quantcast</a> data is accuracy. As with some of the other sources the traffic data is estimated and is nowhere near accurate on the sites for which Quantcast had any data. Data was off by as much as 10 times the actual analytics data for some of the sites. Again, I cannot say that I would recommend sharing any of the data with a client as an accurate predictor of a competitor's traffic.</p> <p><strong>Best Use of Quantcast:</strong><br /> Although the data is not particularly reliable for the traffic data some of the other tools the site has to offer seem quite interesting and worth further investigation. The demographics information is also particularly interesting because it provides a reference as to how the data compare against the internet average. This sort of data could be particularly valuable for analysing a market by compiling data across multiple sites.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free.<br /> &nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>SEMrush</strong></h2> <p><strong>Strengths:</strong><br /> Data Includes sites of all sizes<br /> List of Keyphrases and rankings for thos terms<br /> Most accurate numbered data of all tools looked at</p> <p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong><br /> Data imperfect<br /> Pay to get full data lists<br /> Data only for Google traffic</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img width="550" height="328" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/sem rush.JPG" alt="" /></p> <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong><br /> The data was not perfectly accurate, though generally speaking <a href="http://www.semrush.com/">SEMrush</a> did not miss the mark for any of the sites we tested the same way a number of the other tools did. This is, obviously not to say that this data is infallible or that there won't be some issues with some sites, but the data was surprisingly accurate. As with some of the Google data the information reported is just the Google SE traffic, but this is our main area of focus and was quite accurate when drilling down into that specific area of traffic within analytics.</p> <p><strong>Best Use of SEMrush:</strong><br /> Although imperfect, this tool came the closest to providing accurate data that I would at least with a word of warning, be willing to share with a client about potential expectations or about where there competitors may be traffic wise. Most importantly, the add-on options and ability to see the keyword lists and how the competitor ranks for these terms is extraordinarily appealing to me.</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free-$499 per month</p> <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3> <p>I hope that the findings from all this research will be valuable to you. At the end of the day it is an incomplete study and I look forward to following up on it when I have another big chunk of time and if/when I get access to comScore, HitWise, Compete PRO and SEMrush Pro. For the time being I would rely most heavily on SEMrush for predicting traffic and estimating how well a competitor is doing, but all of these tools add something to the ever growing toolbelt even if it may be for a purpose other than that which I was hoping they would achieve for me - we all know I love to misuse tools and I'm sure I will come up with some creative ways to use these insights.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Thanks a lot and look forward to any feedback you might have in the comments below or feel free to contact me on <a href="http://twitter.com/samuelcrocker">Twitter</a>.</p><br /><p>Do you like this post? <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/11426/1/0">Yes</a> <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/11426/0/0">No</a> </p><div class="feedflare">

<h2>Video Transcription</h2>
<blockquote>This week we're going to be talking about building a monthly SEO action
plan. You can see we've got lots of action graphics up here. It even says
"more action" on both sides. So, you know it's going to be very
actionable.
<br /><br />
Basically, Danny Dover, who does SEO for us here at SEOmoz, and I were kind
of talking about how a lot of folks in the sphere, eventually you get to
this point where you've kind of fixed a lot of the problems that exist on
the site, taken care of some of those missed opportunities, and you're more
in the groove with SEO. Now, you're thinking, how do I build, how do I
expand, how do I go beyond? What's my kind of monthly to-do list as an
SEO? This action plan is here to help.
<br /><br />
Step one, we're starting with some diagnostic stuff. At the beginning of
every month, or depending on your lifecycle of doing this type of work it
could be every week, you want to be running some diagnostics. I mean
diagnostics like error checking and looking for problems and opportunities
in your site. Things like, oh, we have these pages that 404. We blocked
these pages with robots.txt. These are 302 redirects instead of 301s. All
these types of things that you want to keep your eye on so that in case
someone in engineering or development rolls out some new pages or there are
some new things happening inside your website that you don't know about or
something broke, you can identify those quickly and get them fixed up
before they cause you massive trouble in the SERPs.
<br /><br />
Step two, once you've gone beyond that, taken care of those, you want to
collect some key metrics and measurement. This is probably a once a week
kind of thing on a light level and maybe each month you might go a little
bit deeper with some of these metrics. So, things like at a top level
measuring visits from each search engine, the number of pages that are
receiving traffic, the keywords that are sending those traffic, how many of
those there are. Comparing that to the last few months and seeing how your
progress is doing. How is that matching up against your goals? If SEO is
a big part of what you are doing, are you hitting those numbers that you
want to be hitting? Maybe watching some rankings as well. You could be
doing things like competitive intelligence. I'm not just watching my site.
I'm also watching these two other competitors through a rank tracking
system, through software.
<br /><br />
You could do this for links, for all sorts of competitive data as well.
Just be kind of keeping tabs on, "Wow. Hey, my competitors are really
accelerating their link growth. Where did those links come from? Oh,
they've engaged in this type of a link building activity." Maybe they've
been blogging a lot more. Maybe they've been producing some viral content.
Maybe they've been engaging in PR. They've been speaking at events.
Whatever it is that they are generating, you want to be seeing how they're
doing it and what they're doing so you can keep tabs on it and know, maybe
I need to bring that back to my organization.
<br /><br />
So, these metrics or measurements should be going into sort of a
standardized format that you're producing reports either internally for
yourself, for your boss, for your clients all the time.
<br /><br />
Then you can move on to step three, which is kind of trying to recognize
some of these keyword and content opportunities. I might be looking here,
let's imagine that maybe my site is Australian focused for example. Maybe
I'm looking for keywords like wallaby catcher. I'm not ranked for that.
There's some search volume around that. Vegemite sculptures, that's
moderately interesting. I guess I'm glad I don't have to see one of those.
It seems like it would have to be cold out before that would hold
together. And those kiwi rascals over in New Zealand. There are lots of
people searching for that. So, I definitely want to target that one.
That's going to be an important keyword. So, you can go through that kind
of keyword list. There might be new keywords that you'd like to rank for
that have emerged as being popular. Your business could be entering into
new areas where you say, "Boy, we weren't in the wallaby catcher business
last month, but this month we're starting to go in there, so let's do some
keyword research around that, see if there's content we can build." Once
you have these keyword targets, you're going to need to set some content
goals for yourself. Like, "Hey we're going to need to produce content
around this." Landing pages, blog posts, downloads of white papers,
articles. Whatever the content is that matches up against that content,
you're going to need to get that on the website.
<br /><br />
Then step four, you're kind of going to be worrying about social/public
relations, link building, all that outreach and engagement kind of stuff
that's hopefully going to bring value, both branding value and awareness
value as well as direct links back to your site. You might be looking on
places like Twitter or in the blogosphere or in the press and media world
or inside your own industry, internally. You might be looking at trade
organizations or business listing directories, those kinds of things.
Saying, who do I need to engage at those places? How do I connect with
them? Where should I engage? So, you know, this kind of a question can be
things like, boy, you know, there is this new forum that's getting a lot of
popularity, or there's this new blog that's really taking off, or there's a
new Q&A site that's kind of going wild in my sphere and I want to make sure
that I'm sort of in at the ground floor participating in those places.
When Twitter came out, you want to be there. Now something like a Quora is
out, maybe you want to be there. Maybe even something like Namesake,
right, which is kind of getting some traction in the Web 2.0 Silicon Valley
space. You want to be on that. Or Foursquare, Gowalla, these kinds of
things. Particularly if you are location based.
<br /><br />
Then you need to be asking questions as well, like, "What can I do to stand
out and get noticed?" There's a lot of people who are going to be
participating in all of these places -- bloggers, PR people, people who own
websites who want to get links from. They're all going to be getting
pitches from people like you, and you need to find a way to get noticed, to
be unique from that crowd. That means identifying things. I think the
easiest way to do that, unless you're an extremely creative person, is to
see what works for other people in other places. If I wanted to get a blog
post to go popular on Hacker News or on Reddit or get a lot of StumbleUpon
traffic, I would look at what are those sites covering? What are people
voting on at those sites? What does TechCrunch cover? What does
ReadWriteWeb cover? What does my local newspaper cover? Find what those
things are. See those stories. After a couple weeks or few months of
reading that, you'll have a great sixth sense about what content that is.
<br /><br />
Then, finally, are there existing initiatives that need some SEO help?
This can happen quite a bit actually, where there are people in your
organization who are doing things around PR and engagement, who are doing
technical things around the website, who are producing new kinds of
content, but they're not necessarily thinking like you are. They're not
thinking about, "Oh, right. The links and the anchor text, that's
important." And, "Oh, right, the keywords, I need to worry about what the
page content is, do some keyword research, and make sure the focus is
right." Or, "Oh, wait, I should be making sure that these pages aren't
redirecting improperly or carrying the wrong kinds of display codes or
using JavaScript to link to everything instead of straight HTML." It's
your responsibility to keep up with all those existing initiatives inside
the organization. That's why an SEO needs to be well plugged in to
everything that's happening at the company.
<br /><br />
All right. Hope you've enjoyed this SEO action plan and that you'll join
us again for another edition of Whiteboard Friday. Take care.</blockquote>

Apparently, the shop had been engaging in &ldquo;black hat&rdquo; techniques. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the teller of the tale made a &ldquo;tsk tsk&rdquo; sound at the end to help emphasize this as another instance where people who do evil get their just desserts.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">But I think there is a fundamental disjoint in even using the phrase &ldquo;black hat&rdquo; &ndash; as it does infer a big gap in morality. And &lsquo;black hats&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t going around stealing the life savings of pensioners, killing kittens, or committing other dastardly deeds. What they are doing is gaming the system.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">In Italy, there is a word for when someone uses audacity to gain advantage: &ldquo;Furbo&rdquo;.&nbsp; And it is, in a way, considered a virtue.&nbsp; In many cultures, it isn&rsquo;t a bad thing at all to be a &ldquo;player&rdquo;.&nbsp; So how is it, in my own circle of SEO experts, black hat is spoken of with such disdain? Mind you, I&rsquo;m not advocating black hat seo tactics &ndash; as I&rsquo;ll explain in more detail in a bit. But by framing the black/white hat discussion in terms of morality, we might be distorting the real meaning behind the concepts.</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>What IS happening in Black Hat</strong></p>  <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">What IS happening in black hat is the gaming, or the attempt at gaming the system.&nbsp; And in this case, the system is usually Google.&nbsp; Now, Google, we hope, wants to present the best search results to its users.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not always sure about that, and not at all sure that the reality isn&rsquo;t that Google wants to present the best results to its users that helps Google make the most money.&nbsp; If we&rsquo;re going to discuss ethics, there is a whole topic for discussion in that.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">In a way, as a professional SEO, what we want to do is get Google to see our page as being more relevant to a topic than our competitor&rsquo;s page.&nbsp; And who is to say it isn&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Google, as we know, has an algorithm, albeit a SECRET algorithm &ndash; and we can all find countless examples of where Google does not provide the best results.&nbsp; So, we&rsquo;re asking, is Google a better arbiter of best results?</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">Let&rsquo;s consider a black hat tactic I recently heard discussed at SMX East, the acquisition of an old well-indexed website, and then peppering it with back links to our web page.&nbsp; Those link&rsquo;s were NOT part of the original content of the site &ndash; and perhaps not even relevant to the content of that old well-indexed site &ndash; so in essence, the black hat is using Google&rsquo;s system to sort of cheat a little.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">By the way; there are some interesting studies (<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2009/03/13/dan_ariely_offe/">http://blog.ted.com/2009/03/13/dan_ariely_offe/</a> ) that show that MOST people WILL cheat in small incremental ways if they believe that can go undetected.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just a little cheat.&nbsp; In game theory, this is an aspect of the &ldquo;Tragedy of the Commons&rdquo; &ndash; people will take a little bit from the group if their actions benefit themselves a lot, but only hurt the group a little.&nbsp; The problem is, of course, that all those little hurts to the group add up.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">Now, isn&rsquo;t it true that emphasizing a key phrase in meta tags, H1&rsquo;s, links, etc, is ALSO gaming the system? Maybe it is gaming the system but in a lesser way than acquiring a mothballed site. But if we&rsquo;re talking about ethics, can we really talk degrees of ethics, and where do we score the little measures?</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Mrs. Google</strong></p>  <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">Imagine a classroom where the teacher up front is Mrs. Google, and all of the students are us SEO&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mrs. Google asks a question, &ldquo;who is the most relevant student here to answer this question&rdquo;?&nbsp; And we all raise our hands &ndash; each one of us wants her to notice ME, we want to her to pick ME!&nbsp; And sometimes, to get noticed, maybe we sort of bounce up and down in our seats, to help influence her choosing.&nbsp; But should the student doing the most bouncing up and down in their seat be chosen?&nbsp; Are they really the most relevant?&nbsp; Now, maybe one student not only bobs up and down in his seat, but emits a small chirping sound! Is the chirper a black hat?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t he using a method of getting called-on that has nothing to do with the fairness of his being chosen?</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">So; what I&rsquo;m suggesting is that black hats are simply taking their methods of being noticed FURTHER than white hats &ndash; and in comparison to most SEO professionals, is only doing what is done by everyone, just in greater degrees.</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><strong>Beyond Good and Evil</strong></p>  <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">As an SEO, I discourage the use of so-called black hat techniques.&nbsp; Simply put, they can result in a web site&rsquo;s being perceived as deserving a Google purgatory.&nbsp; It would be irresponsible to put a website at risk in that way.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a risk management issue, not a moral issue.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">The SERP has been dying a long and painful death. Every so often, a new Google enhancement causes SERP to be less relevant &ndash; instant search, local results, etc.&nbsp; In other words, DYNAMIC results based on the searcher&rsquo;s demographics or behavior.&nbsp; Cool.&nbsp; And by focusing more on creating content that is rich in relevant clouds of words and phrases, we&rsquo;re not simply trying to be perceived as being more relevant, we&rsquo;re focusing on BEING more relevant.&nbsp; It takes the entire discussion outside of the black hat/white hat.</p> <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>  <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dragonsearchmarketing.com/blog/author/dragon/">About Ric Dragon</a></p><br /><p>Do you like this post? <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/11331/1/0">Yes</a> <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/11331/0/0">No</a> </p><div class="feedflare">

While the word itself annoys me, the process of<em> improving what you have to get more from it</em> still rings true. I&nbsp;think we can all get onboard with the concept, but what about the process behind it? I&nbsp;am constantly surprised by the number of people that tell me their boss or client simply doesn't want to spend time on landing page optimization.</p><p>I've put together a little something I&nbsp;think explains the norm pretty well:<br />&nbsp;</p><p><img width="620" height="306" align="middle" alt="LPO conversation" src="http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/debate.png" /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Origional photos courtesy of <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com">Shutterstock</a>).<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Instead they would rather work on increasing traffic to <strike>ugly</strike> unoptimized pages. While you would think selling LPO&nbsp;in-house would be an easy task, you would be surprised. Often I&nbsp;hear objections centered around lack of resources, inability to project return, and my personal favorite--&quot;We simple don't have time to revisit pages that are already built.&quot;</p><p>Uhmmmm. Okayyyy.</p><p>So you, myself, and the rest of the cool kids know that optimizing your landing pages can be a huge win for your company, but how do you make the case for it in-house? It just so happens I&nbsp;have a few ideas for you on this. Below you'll find seven ways I've been able to convince clients and bosses to take a break from building up, and rework the foundation. Hopefully, you can use some of these the next time you are faced with what I&nbsp;call, &quot;The Anti-Optimizers.&quot;</p><p><strong>1. Evangelize the cause prior to starting.</strong> <br />You know that old saying, &quot;make the case before you need the win?&quot; Yeah me neither, I&nbsp;just made it up, but it stands true in this case. For most things you want to push through in-house, you will see less resistance if you start talking it up prior to the pitch. For LPO in particular, I&nbsp;suggest sending out emails with links to good case studies that show the value of LPO, or possibly dropping stats in meetings about how simple tweaks can result in &quot;X.&quot; Doing all of this before asking them to allocate resources can set a great base for future conversations.</p><p><strong>2. Pull the numbers to make a case in-house. <br /></strong>Call me a pessimist at heart but I&nbsp;love looking up crappy data. Yup it's true. The good news is we all have some of it to find. Your client, your company, whoever you are hoping to convince has data sitting in their analytics to help make the case for LPO efforts. The hard part is not necessarily finding the data, but relaying it in a positive light. You need to show all of the low hanging fruit around you. <br /><br />Examples include things like showing industry standards for metrics like bounce rates or time on site, and then highlighting your own and the..uhmmm...discrepancies. Another idea is pulling your best converting pages, and showing what %&nbsp;of your site fails to perform at that standard or anywhere near it really. Those simple data pulls can go a long way.</p><p><strong>3. Show potential successes.</strong><br /> Okay for you optimistic, rainbow-loving, happy data people...this one is for you. Do the number crunching. Take the time to show what an increase in performance could mean to your bottom-line. The best way to do this is to show ranges. Show them what a 10%&nbsp;increase in X would mean, a 5% increase in X would mean, and what<em> something as small</em> as a 2%&nbsp;increase in X would mean (don't forget to stress &quot;something as small&quot; and pause for dramatic affect...it works). By highlighting the potential successes, you turn that negative conversation into an opportunity for growth.</p><p><strong>4. Know the costs &amp; resources involved. <br /></strong>This is all about doing your homework. Just like any other time you try to convince someone to spend time or money on something, you should be prepared to give estimations. Whether you use a free tool like GWO, or another option that costs a monthly price, have those numbers on hand.<br /><br /> Also know how much design and dev time you will require for these changes and tests to get up on your site. You will be prepared for the questions, and hopefully put to rest any concerns about LPO wasting your company's money and resources.</p><p><strong>5. Show competitors and their efforts.</strong> <br />This one is another favorite of mine. Nothing lights a fire like showing people where they are losing ground. If you want to make a case for your company doing LPO, what better way than to show your competitor testing out homepages, landing pages, different buttons, colors, etc. It may take a while to snag the screenshots, but it is sooo worth it. Trust me.</p><p><strong>6. Run a small test behind closed doors &amp; preach results. </strong><br />This one is a bit of a gamble, mainly because it could totally backfire...but hey who doesn't love a little risk? Exactly. So get testing. Take one of your medium trafficked pages, and set up a quick A/B test. Change something drastic though--like the intention of the call to action, page layout and nav, or possibly the entire color scheme. <br /><br />You may be thinking wouldn't this be more like a multivariate test, doesn't this get complicated? Well yeah, but you aren't really testing in hopes of finding out something revolutionary. Hear me out. This is what we call --down and dirty testing. Show two vary drastic alternatives for one page. Show Page A to 50% and Page B to 50% of your traffic , your results may not be the key to your company's success, but it will prove that different landing page experiences evoke very different actions by users. It's intuitive to us marketers, but sometimes people truly believe all pages are equal. Scary, I&nbsp;know.</p><p><strong>7. Take ownership, start the ball rolling. </strong><br />This is my last and final idea for you...it's sort of like a virtual high five. When it comes to making the case for anything in-house, I&nbsp;find the most effective way to convince people something is worth doing...is by doing it. So go get started, get the specs written, or the test versions mocked up. Then pitch the four to six steps left, explain how the hard work is done, and it's time to push it live. Your drive for the project will be appreciated, and hopefully the ambition will be contagious.</p><p>Well there you go. Hopefully you can use some of this the next time you run into a wall. LPO is no longer a side project we run when we &quot;think something is wrong,&quot; it should be an ongoing process at every company. If you spend time driving traffic to your pages, you should spend time improving those pages.</p><p>Do you have a favorite tool or tactic for awesome LPO? I'd love if you left them in the comments below! We can all start sharing the LPO love together, group hug anyone?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Do you like this post? <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/11389/1/0">Yes</a> <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/thumbs/add/blog/11389/0/0">No</a> </p><div class="feedflare">
