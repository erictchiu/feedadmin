<p>There is an error that I often see made on the other end of the spectrum.  I have worked with several product teams over the years who have designed functionality that works really well for minimal usage &#8211; say where you do the task once or twice per day.  But there are many features that need to be used by a small portion of the user base in a super repetitive way.  To these power users often the initial use case is totally unusable.</p>
<p>So the opposite problem is when you over optimize a power feature for solely the novice and it becomes unusable for an iterative process (usually performed by a power user).  Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>At my first startup, we built a feature for creating project tasks.  We all know a thing or two about project management so they had a pretty good feel what they wanted to build.  They built in a bunch of really nice features like making the task-list embeddable in meeting notes so that you could show your output of a meeting including all of the tasks generated and if it was a &#8220;standing&#8221; meeting then it would print a list of tasks not yet completed by the next meeting.  It had the usual stuff like priorities, assignments, work effort level, etc.</p>
<p>And it worked brilliantly.  With one exception.  Our system was used on large scale engineering projects who had weekly or monthly meetings.  Each meeting generated hundreds of action items to be followed up on.  And it was usually one person from the meeting&#8217;s responsibility to input all of the actions into the system.  The best format for this person would have been a spreadsheet like input screen because 50 actions at a time might relate to one person or one company.  50 actions might be of a certain &#8220;type&#8221; and there may be 200 actions overall.</p>
<p>Our system only allowed you to create one action at a time so you had to go through an iterative process of create task, fill in details, assign task, save and then repeat.  Pretty dumb of us.</p>
<p>Ultimately we left the core functionality as it was.  We then added a small link that let you &#8220;create a major to-do list&#8221; or some similar wording.  That would send a more advanced user into a spreadsheet-like input screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this &#8220;error of iteration&#8221; occur many times in software designs.  One example is Quora.  I spoke in the design simplicity post about how it&#8217;s one of my favorite new products from a UX (and functionality!) perspective.  But they&#8217;re missing the design iteration concept.  They publish the &#8220;3 notifications&#8221; at a time in the top center of the screen.</p>
<p>This is great for the novice.  But for me it has become unusable.  For example, some days I&#8217;ll get 20-30 new followers.  Each time I need to open &#8220;items related to you&#8221; tab to see who these people are and choose which to follow.  When I click on &#8220;follow&#8221; one person the whole fracking thing closes and makes me do it all over again.  Sigh.</p>
<p>I encourage all product teams to ask to speak to the customer who would use your product repetitive, all day long and understand how they work.  While it might be an edge case, it is an important one.  Your &#8220;power users&#8221; will be either your most vocal supporters or the biggest pains in your arse.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fritzon/4711241023/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4131" title="ipad novice" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ipad-novice1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>I&#8217;ve had a long-standing rule of thumb in product design, which I call &#8220;design for the novice, configure for the pro.&#8221;  I started saying this back in 2001/02, long before the era of Web 2.0, lean startups or even the advent of AJAX.</p>
<p>My philosophy emanated from my days of programming and later designing corporate software in the early 1990&#8242;s.  We were smart kids straight out of college and were designing the systems that we&#8217;d want to use.  We were young, computer literate and interested in learning about or playing with new technologies.</p>
<p>I watched us build systems for large corporations whose employees were in their 40&#8242;s / 50&#8242;s and who were primarily concerned with completing their business functions rapidly and with limited errors.  In designing GUI interfaces for people coming from the <a href="http://computer.yourdictionary.com/green-screen" target="_blank">green-screen</a> world we built applications that would be great for desktop publishing, not customer service reps.  We built in too many clicks, too many features, too many distractions.  We were confident we had improved things until we got to usability testing and watched with horror.</p>
<p>Fast forward a decade and now I had a startup filled with smart web developers.  I was 31 and they were in their 20&#8242;s.  Invariably they would build in too much functionality and assume that users were both familiar with and interested in having tons of choice.  My mantra back then was &#8220;what would your mom be able to use?&#8221;  Simplify, simplify, simplify.</p>
<p>Of course the debates raged about not wanting to make the system less powerful.  My view &#8211; power users always look at all of the menu options to figure out how to juice up the system.  You can always hide complexity into configuration screens rather than the out-of-the-box features.</p>
<p>Even in 2010 I think most companies err too much on the side of complexity.  They try to strike the right balance between making the base product &#8220;useful enough&#8221; for the &#8220;average&#8221; user.  I think the novice needs to be able to walk right in the door and be able to start playing around with your product &#8211; without a manual.  More difficult still, you need to be able to accomodate the &#8220;light&#8221; user who comes by once / month and barely remembers the application when the log in.</p>
<p>Obviously this doesn&#8217;t hold true for every application but it does for many.  And as much as we&#8217;d like to think otherwise, most people don&#8217;t really care about our company or our product &#8211; most people come by infrequently.  And if you can make life easier for these people then more of them will convert to become more frequent users.</p>
<p>I think one of the products that does this best in my mind is Gmail.  They do an incredible job of hiding most of their functionality yet allowing power users to soup things up if they want to.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you, it has been a while since I&#8217;ve actually done wireframes and designs but you never really lose the feel for what the right balance is to create a good UX.  It&#8217;s why when I used Quora I instantly felt like it was the most innovative UX I had seen in years.  It is beautiful in its simplicity (although I think I could give them a few tips to improve usability if they ever asked <img src='http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>So when some of the younger guys at startups I&#8217;ve funded start teasing me about my gray hair and that they&#8217;re now designing products for me (as opposed to their moms!) I say, &#8220;bring it on.&#8221;  I recently argued with a team for 6 months that they were intellectualizing their product too much and that the masses would want a simpler version.  They fought me for months and later admitted they needed to reduce the complexity of their product.  It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m smarter &#8211; it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve been through 10 more years of watching users play with products (and across many different tech stacks and form factors).</p>
<p>In summary, 2 quick rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do usability testing.  Watch people use your product with little or no instructions.  Give them tasks to complete without instructions of how to complete the tasks.  Film them.  Learn from them.  Many companies do this these days &#8211; not all do.  You MUST.  It is so instructive.  It will blow your mind away how people use products differently than you&#8217;d intend them to.  You&#8217;ll pull your hair out.  And in the end I&#8217;m quite sure that you&#8217;ll simplify things &#8211; not add things.</li>
<li>Design for the novice.  Configure fo the pro.  The pro will always find the advanced options.  This is easier said than done.  It&#8217;s always harder to build simple, yet usable products.  You become more defined as much by what you left out or simplified as by what you put in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll offer up design tip number 2: paying attention to iterative processes.</p>

<p>Minimalism beats clutter.  Substance trumps verbosity.</p>
<p>For years I&#8217;ve been offering advice on how to better communicate and for years I&#8217;ve seen most people commit the same universal mistake: Including too many details.  Less is more effective.  Less has more impact.  Less actually takes more effort.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s start with resumes as the perfect metaphor and then expand.</p>
<p><strong>Resumes</strong><br />
Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve had 3-5 jobs in your career since college and for each job you list 5 key achievements.  If the recruiting manager&#8217;s job consisted solely of reviewing your resume it would be an easy task.  They&#8217;d read the whole thing and you&#8217;d look like the stellar candidate you know you are.  The reality is that they have hundreds of resumes on their desk so they apply filters and spend more time on those that get through the filter.  They look quickly for key facts such as where you worked, how long you were there, what role you played and maybe they&#8217;ll look for some key accomplishments.</p>
<p>So the problem is that if you have a few outstanding achievements they get lost in the sea of all the other shite you put in as fillers to make it look like you did a lot more.  Many people feel the need to tell the reader everything they worked on rather than the 3 biggest accomplishments.  I always advise people to only put the things that had the biggest impact to maximize the chance that they&#8217;ll actually be seen.  It follows the same rule as with comma&#8217;s, &#8220;<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/when_in_doubt_leave_it_out_tshirt-235979325347730227" target="_blank">when in doubt, leave it out</a>.&#8221;  <a href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/When+in+Doubt,+Leave+It+Out" target="_blank">WIDLIO</a>.  That way the reader isn&#8217;t searching through a haystack to find your needles.</p>
<p><strong>VC Pitch Decks</strong><br />
My recommendation is to have an 8-12 slide decks with only the most critical factors of your business.  The great thing about the VC pitch deck is that you can have 30 slides.  The first 10 can be the &#8220;main event&#8221; and the next 20 can be listed behind a slide called &#8220;appendix.&#8221;  Investors don&#8217;t mind this &#8211; if they&#8217;re interested they&#8217;ll read more slides.  But the people who get 100+ decks / month can quickly get through yours and see whether there is a fit.</p>
<p>Each slide should be minimalist, more graphics and less text.  Where there is text it should be modeled after the resume (i.e. bullet points, shortened text, easy-to-read).  Often the bio slides have 3-5 people&#8217;s names on them followed by long paragraphs of their achievements.  If a VC only read your deck that would be fine but we&#8217;re no different than recruiters &#8211; we get more paperwork than we can process.  The easier you make it the more likely we&#8217;ll see &#8220;the good stuff.&#8221;  Less is more.</p>
<p><strong>Presentations</strong><br />
You&#8217;ve been given 10 minutes to stand on stage and tell what your company does and why it matters.  Too many people have 15-20 slides.  Do the math &#8211; you&#8217;ll never get through it all.  If you do, nobody will remember what you did.  The golden rule for slides is to assume 1-2 minutes per slide &#8211; and that is if you&#8217;re well practiced.  So if you have 10 minutes you should have 7-10 slides with huge graphics, limited text and large fonts.  Leave the audience wanting to learn more.  Make 3 big points and repeat them so that people can remember.  Give them the iPod not Microsoft Office products.  Less is more.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis / Conclusions</strong><br />
One of the most common tasks of &#8220;knowledge workers&#8221; is to analyze a situation and present conclusions to others in order to make decisions on a project.  Throughout my career I&#8217;ve produced hundreds of these reports.  In order to improve the efficacy of my reports I often would write an &#8220;executive summary&#8221; as the start that would have one paragraph describing the problem I was trying to solve, one paragraph talking through the options considered and one paragraph with my conclusion.</p>
<p>I would then have as many pages of analysis as required to show the detailes of my review.  But I knew that the busiest people often wanted to know the answer up front and to probe into the details if they were concerned with how we got to an answer.  I never wanted to &#8220;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bury_the_lead" target="_blank">bury the lead</a>.&#8221;  For the senior executives reading my reports, less was more.  They often wanted the answer quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Products</strong><br />
One of the great developments over the past five years has been the simplification of software.  We spend the previous 15 years with annual releases of bloatware.  Apple has shown us the way.  If you can pick up a product and use it with no manual it is well designed.  And nobody <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=RTFM" target="_blank">RTFM&#8217;s</a>.  Palm did a great job before Apple and before they had a brain fart and didn&#8217;t realize that people wanted email on their PDA&#8217;s &#8211; ceding the market to Blackberry (who in turn somehow haven&#8217;t figured out how to do a browser in the 4 years since Apple launched the iPhone).</p>
<p>I review many products every week.  I&#8217;d say I see way more products with too many features / too much complexity than I do ones with not enough.  I&#8217;m going to write a post soon with my personal product design philosophy, &#8220;design for the novice, configure for the pro.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
There are so many instances in the business world where less is more that I&#8217;d encourage you to always ask yourself whether this might actually be the case in your situation.  This includes emails, phone calls, elevator pitches, presentations, products, resumes, training manuals, you name it.  I can&#8217;t say it always applies but more than you&#8217;d imagine.  Remember the adage: when in doubt, leave it out.</p>
<p><strong>A Word on Hypocrisy </strong><br />
Wait a second.  You&#8217;re telling us that less is more? You, the king of the overly long blog posts?</p>
<p>Ha. Yes.  I think my blog posts would be far better if I made them 50% of the length.  The problem is that often less takes longer than more.  It&#8217;s the irony of less.  Less is more powerful but it&#8217;s often harder to produce.  I made a decision in blogging that I wanted to opt for frequency and depth of thought.  If I took the time to write less I would produce 50% of the content.</p>
<p>The normal process for me is sit at my computer for an hour (usually at 10pm), crank out a quick post, spell check, find an image and hit publish.  Often the next day I&#8217;ll edit it 10% at the margin when I re-read it and find errors.</p>
<p>I opt for more because in the case of my blog &#8211; less would take too much effort.  In other activities I actually put in a lot of effort to deliver higher quality outputs with less.</p>

<p>I had breakfast with <a href="http://twitter.com/davetisch" target="_blank">David Tisch</a> the other morning in NYC.  If you don&#8217;t know David he&#8217;s the guy who will be running <a href="http://www.techstars.org/nyc/" target="_blank">TechStars New York</a> starting in January.  And that&#8217;s a great thing because I was really impressed with him.  Surprisingly so.</p>
<p>He had a ton of great ideas about what he wanted to do with TechStars NY.  I&#8217;ve agreed to come out in the new year and spend a few days with the entrepreneurs who join TechStars NYC (as well as Boulder).  I love this program.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running Launchpad LA (very similar to TechStars) for 2 years but I must say I had some great take-aways at breakfast from David who hasn&#8217;t even run his first group yet!  I&#8217;m always impressed when people are wise beyond their years and felt like David was a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>One of the things we were chatting about was how many first-time entrepreneurs have grown up digital natives so have a really good intuitive feel for technology &amp; design but don&#8217;t yet have the business basics down.  This shows itself when people try to do an elevator pitch, send concise, actionable emails or have a quick phone call with you to ask for help.  David said he wants to be sure his class is grounded in the business basics that will help with success &#8211; this is smart and I plan to copy him.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.feld.com" target="_blank">Brad Feld</a> told me that TechStars makes each company practice the 1 or 2-minute pitch the first week of the program.  Whenever somebody visits a TechStars office they go around and meet the companies and hear these pitches.  It gets drilled into each founder the need to have a pithy overview of their business and why it&#8217;s relevant.  Smart.  It&#8217;s one of the most common activities of an entrepreneur used in recruiting, marketing, sales, networking, biz dev, etc.  I plan to do this with the next Launchpad LA class.  If you haven&#8217;t read about <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/08/15/i-buy-dead-magazines-the-art-of-the-intro/" target="_blank">Sam Jones and &#8220;dead magazines&#8221;</a> it&#8217;s worth your time to have a quick read.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.2px;">So I thought I&#8217;d blog about one of the topics we discussed at breakfast &#8211; the phone call.  I&#8217;m not talking about a sales call, getting past the assistant or anything like that. I&#8217;m talking about simple and quick calls to your business peers, VCs or other players in your ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><strong>How Can I Help?</strong></p>
<p>Angels, entrepreneurs, VCs, bloggers and the like all get a ton of requests for &#8220;just 15 minutes&#8221; phone calls.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m OK with this.  One of the more rewarding parts of my job is being able to help other people.  It&#8217;s high in the gratification quadrant when somebody comes back and says that our chat made a difference in their business.</p>
<p>The truth is I think that it&#8217;s part of human nature to want to try and help others so you&#8217;d be surprised how many people will find ways to help if asked appropriately or by the right person.</p>
<p>So when a person calls me and we&#8217;re 10 minutes into the call and it&#8217;s not clear why they&#8217;re calling I&#8217;m usually thinking to myself, &#8220;what was the reason they wanted to call me in the first place?  What are they hoping to achieve?&#8221; and mostly, &#8220;How can I help?&#8221;</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t get to the point and since the distance between my random inner-head mutterings and my mouth are too small and my ADHD too great, it often just blurts out of me like Tourette&#8217;s syndrome, &#8220;Let me just stop you there.  How can I best help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what we want.  It&#8217;s what you want.  Let&#8217;s be explicit about it.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my advice:</p>
<p><strong>1. You can start informally with banter </strong>- If I&#8217;m calling somebody I know a bit I usually try to start with a little friendly banter.  If I know they like a sports team that might be a good start.  If I saw their company in the press, heard that they saw somebody at an event that I know, they live in a town where a storm just rolled through &#8211; whatever.  I think trying to humanize the call from the outset is good.  When you jump straight into &#8220;sales pitch mode&#8221; it feels a bit strange.</p>
<p>Two things to watch for: 1) if you&#8217;re trying banter to build rapport but not &#8220;feeling it&#8221; then quickly shift to business.  Some people just aren&#8217;t &#8220;chit chatters&#8221; and prefer to get on with things. I find that kinda boring, but I know some people are just wired that way.  2) some callers take this banter too far  It starts to border on disrespectful of the person&#8217;s time or wasteful of your 15 minutes.  Don&#8217;t be that person.</p>
<p>How long you go for is really a judgment call because there&#8217;s no right answer.  If it&#8217;s somebody that I know really well and I confirm that they&#8217;re not rushing to do something else I might even take 10-15 minutes just to &#8220;catch up.&#8221;  If it&#8217;s a general acquaintance it&#8217;s probably more like 3-4 minutes.  If it&#8217;s a first time call you might try to keep it at 2 minutes or less.</p>
<p>So even if the person you called is really chatty don&#8217;t be undisciplined and let them talk too long.  You have limited time on the call, presumably you called for a reason and you&#8217;re chewing up your valuable clock.</p>
<p><strong>2. Let them know why you&#8217;re calling</strong> - When you&#8217;re ready to pivot the conversation your next line should be some derivative of, &#8220;listen, the reason I&#8217;m calling is &#8230; blah, blah, blah&#8221;  25% of people or less actually do this.  They just talk and I&#8217;m not really sure why they called.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re calling for a reason, the sooner the recipient knows the sooner they can help.  If the clock runs out they&#8217;re not going to be able to help.  Even if you don&#8217;t have a single &#8220;ask&#8221; I recommend saying something like, &#8220;listen, I&#8217;m going to make this call short.  I don&#8217;t have anything I&#8217;m asking for, I was just hoping to get 10 minutes of your time to tell you what we&#8217;re up to so that the next chance we get to meet down the line you&#8217;ve got more of an understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Don&#8217;t hang yourself</strong> &#8211; One of the other big mistakes callers make is going &#8220;off to the races&#8221; talking about their business without getting any feedback from the recipient of the call.  This is bad enough in person but I promise you if you do it over the phone the recipient will start to tune out.  If you listen closely you&#8217;ll probably even hear the tapping of a keyboard.  You can talk for a bit but then seek feedback and make sure the other person is &#8220;with you.&#8221;  When I used to do a lot of recruiting we used to call it &#8220;hanging yourself&#8221; because people who talk for long periods of time without seeking feedback are generally not self-aware or good at human interaction.  Don&#8217;t be that person.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ask questions</strong> &#8211; The best trick for creating a two-way conversation is to ask questions.  You can do this too early in the call and you can&#8217;t be an interview factory, but polite questions relevant to your topic are appropriate.  It will help ensure that you don&#8217;t do all the talking.  Plus, when you listen you learn more anyways.</p>
<p><strong>5. Know what &#8220;the ask&#8221; is</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re set up a call with somebody then know in advance why you&#8217;re calling and what you plan to ask for.  Don&#8217;t ask for four things or you&#8217;ll get none.  Don&#8217;t ask for big favors unless you have a tight relationship.  Don&#8217;t assume that this will be the one and only time you&#8217;ll ever talk to the person.  If you cultivate a good long-term relationship through patience, persistence and reciprocity there will be many more occasions.  So by all means have an &#8220;ask&#8221; but make it: obvious, easy for them to achieve and of a limited number &#8211; preferably one.</p>
<p><strong>6. Stick to your budgeted time &#8211; maybe less</strong> &#8211; When you think of your relationship with the individual as a relationship you&#8217;ll build over time and over many calls, discussions, chats at conferences or whatever you&#8217;ll realize you need to be known for being respectful of other&#8217;s time.  If you&#8217;re known as the person who&#8217;s always long winded you&#8217;re less likely to get the next few calls on the calendar.  Less is better, I promise.</p>
<p>Now go pick up the phone and stop hiding behind emails.  You build real relationships on the phone and in person.  Good luck.</p>

<p>What that means is that in a typical week I might see 10-15 new company pitches.  Sometimes more.  I speak at conferences where I might meet 75-100 people and have conversations.  I do dinners too often as my waistline can attest.  I have long one-on-one conversations with people for hours.</p>
<p>I have Twitter chats, respond to blog comments, trade emails, respond to comments on This Week in VC.</p>
<p>You get the picture.</p>
<p>I actually do have a very good memory.  People are often surprised at the small details I sometimes remember from our initial meetings.  Little tidbits, random facts.  I&#8217;m especially good with numbers &#8211; for some reason that&#8217;s how my brain is wired.  I&#8217;m less good at names.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the thing.  When I see you I&#8217;m probably thinking, &#8220;damn, I know that person.  How do I know them?  How do I know them?  How do I know them?&#8221;  Sometimes this happens even with people I&#8217;ve met several times if I see them out of context (i.e. where I wasn&#8217;t expecting to bump into them).</p>
<p>All I need is a little context.  &#8221;Mark, we met last year at the NYU event.  I spoke briefly to you about my startup in the x,y,z space.  I was formerly at the AP as an international journalist before coming to Stanford to get my masters.&#8221;</p>
<p>BOOM!  I remember!  &#8221;You&#8217;re the guy who built the Twitter plug-in for blogs.  Yeah!  I remember.  I thought that was a cool idea.  So what&#8217;s the latest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if for some reason it slips my brain the context ALWAYS helps.  I know it sounds dumb.  That you could sit in somebody&#8217;s office for an hour and they don&#8217;t instantly remember you even though you had a big chat.  Or even somebody that I had breakfast with!  I do remember these meetings.  I PROMISE I remember them &#8211; I just need the context.</p>
<p>And if I&#8217;m like this, I&#8217;m pretty sure other high-volume people are, too.  And many of the people you want to interact with (VCs, Micro VCs, angels, biz dev teams, corp dev teams, CEOs, journalists &#8230; they are ALL high volume people).  Just remember to give them a little prompt.  Even if you&#8217;re pretty sure they know you it never hurts to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>It will save them from trolling the depths of their mental database trying to place you while you&#8217;re speaking.  And if it&#8217;s me and the lightbulb doesn&#8217;t instantly go off &#8211; please don&#8217;t be offended.  I promise once I have access to my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory" target="_blank">ROM</a> memory I&#8217;ll click into gear.  If only I was a newer model wired with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" target="_blank">SSD</a>.  Alas.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In normal times investors will look for &#8220;traction&#8221; before investing.  We want to make sure we&#8217;re in love.  This sometimes frustrates entrepreneurs who just want to &#8220;get back to running the business.&#8221;  But if you understand it you&#8217;ll see that it is perfectly rational and it should also influence how you form relationships with investors.  And remember, if we get married you&#8217;re stuck with us, too.<a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/investing-in-dots.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4066" title="investing in dots" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/investing-in-dots.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="263" /></a>The first time I meet you, you are a single data point.  A dot.  I have no reference point from which to judge whether you were higher on the y-axis 3 months ago or lower.  Because I have no observation points from the past, I have no sense for where you will be in the future.  Thus, it is very hard to make a commitment to fund you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For this reason I tell entrepreneurs the following: Meet your potential investors early.  Tell them you&#8217;re not raising money yet but that you will be in the next 6 months or so.  Tell them you really like them so you want them to have an early view (which is what all investor&#8217;s want).  When you&#8217;re with them lower the bar by telling them, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t shipped product yet, we have lots of decisions still to make, but we&#8217;d like to show you our prototype&#8221; or obviously if you&#8217;re more advanced show what you have and what your roadmap looks like.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most importantly tell them what you plan to achieve by the next time you see them.  Hopefully by then you&#8217;ve made good progress.  You&#8217;ll be able to give them an update on key hires, pilot customers, key tech innovations &#8211; whatever.  Keep these interactions low-key and short.  Quick coffees, whatever.  Swing by their offices to make it easy for them to say yes and promise not to take up more than 30 minutes for the update (and stick to it).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I spoke about this more in depth in these two posts: <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/10/06/the-four-main-things-that-investors-look-for-in-a-startup/" target="_blank">4 things I look for in an investment</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/08/08/wtf-is-traction-a-6-step-relationship-guide-to-vc/" target="_blank">how to manage VC relationships</a>.  And don&#8217;t allocate two months of each year to &#8220;hardcore funding activities&#8221; but allocate a regular amount of time each month to it like any other job function.  Like it or not &#8211; finance is a major job function in any company &#8211; startup or public company.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lines.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4072" title="lines" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lines.jpg" alt="" width="419" height="266" /></a>The thing is, by the time I get to know you I start to see patterns.  Note that &#8220;performance&#8221; on my chart is a loose term for my definition of perceived progress that can take the form of product, customer adoption, employees, investors, press or whatever.  It is basically a perception that you are making progress in your business and not standing still.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All of these meetings don&#8217;t actually require you to prove that you&#8217;re &#8220;killing it&#8221; over night.  It&#8217;s a chance for us to build a relationship and for the investor to see how you think and how you respond to adversity.  How can you prove <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/12/15/what-makes-an-entrepreneur-111-tenacity/" target="_blank">tenacity</a>, <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/12/18/what-makes-an-entrepreneur-410-resiliency/" target="_blank">resiliency</a> or <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/12/17/what-makes-an-entrepreneur-310-ability-to-pivot/" target="_blank">ability to pivot</a> in a single data point?  I funded <a href="http://ad.ly/" target="_blank">Ad.ly</a> having seen Sean Rad perform over a 1-year period at Orgoo, which didn&#8217;t succeed.  I didn&#8217;t invest in Orgoo but by the time he launched Ad.ly I knew his capabilities and knew I wanted to work with him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had 15 meetings or more with Evan Rifkin over a 2-year period of time long before I invested in <a href="http://www.burstly.com/" target="_blank">Burstly</a>. In fact, long before he had even founded Burstly.  I knew he was one of the most talented entrepreneurs in LA and he has exceeded my expectations since I invested.  Presumably during this interactions Evan also decided I wasn&#8217;t a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;source=imghp&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=644&amp;q=dick+cheney&amp;gbv=2&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=" target="_blank">Dick</a> so the meetings cut both ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I spent the past week in New York.  The profile of one of the hottest companies I met was as per the graph below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hot-deal-in-nyc.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4077" title="hot deal in nyc" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hot-deal-in-nyc.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="274" /></a>The deal is moving a bit too fast for me and is becoming frenzied with interest.  But I really think this company has a good shot at becoming a monster.  It&#8217;s a killer CEO, great product, market ripe for disruption, experienced product team and great CMO who has relevant experience from her former life.  I&#8217;ve been watching from the sidelines for 6 months and waiting to meet the team.  Given a few more data points I would have liked to have invested but given the market speed it looks unlikely.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>So here&#8217;s the thing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investors</strong> &#8211; The market is moving uber fast on deals.  Investors are writing checks for dots.  This is happening with both angels and VCs.  If you invest in dots don&#8217;t be surprised when the trend isn&#8217;t in the direction you would have hoped.  Pattern recognition requires a pattern.  <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/11/14/what-angel-investing-florida-condos-have-in-common/" target="_blank">Dots produce bubbles</a>.  And some argue that <a href="http://twitter.com/danielleahy/status/4409502543650816" target="_blank">bubbles have positive externalities for entrepreneurs </a>- maybe.  But many bubbles wreak more havoc than positive effects.  And those of us who have lived through the past 2 funding bubbles saw all this at close range.  And many I&#8217;m having the debate with are on their first time around.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines vs. Dots &#8211; </strong>Over on HackerNews somebody cleverly wrote, <em>&#8220;Surely someone will invest in the &#8216;dot&#8217; and he&#8217;ll miss the chance. He seems to assume there is no competition. Or maybe what is a dot to him was already a line to someone else (because they met earlier)&#8221; &#8211; </em>this is my point exactly.  If you&#8217;re an investor looking at dots somebody else may be looking at lines.  Meet entrepreneurs early and watch how they perform &#8211; maybe even at their previous startup.  I always ask to meet people before they&#8217;re officially fund raising &#8211; well before actually.  It helps me spot patterns.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurs</strong> &#8211; you might be pumped up with that super quick round done at a high price.  But just remember that raising money is a bit like Ireland in the 90&#8242;s &#8211; no divorces allowed.  I know VCs and sophisticated angels can be difficult, slow and price sensitive, but I also know that in tough times unsophisticated investors can be a right pain in the arse.  For some companies &#8211; they become deal breakers on further funding rounds.  By definition if somebody is investing in you as a dot (limited thought, limited due diligence, maximum price) they are a dot to you, too.  You can&#8217;t really know them in 2 minutes yet you&#8217;re letting them own part of your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUrMcmQClU8" target="_blank">we all know how Vegas weddings turn out</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really hard to zig when the whole world seems to be zagging.  One of my favorite quotes I learned in high school was:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Nonconformity is the Highest Form of Social Attainment&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It was written as the yearbook quote of the smartest seniors as I was finishing my freshman year.  It has always stood with me.  I have had a low bullshit meter.  I remember it even way back in kindergarden when my Saturday school teacher tried to tell me about Noah and Adam &amp; Eve.  Those stories didn&#8217;t sound that plausible to me.  Much to her chagrin, the other slogan I have always lived by is</p>
<blockquote><p><em> &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Authority" target="_blank">Question Authority</a>.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the masses start all running one way without questioning &#8220;why?&#8221; &#8211; and when it defies any logic I can figure out in my head &#8211; I call bullshit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And so it happened that between 2000-2008 I was the biggest buzz kill at dinner parties.  While many of my friends bragged about their 5 condos in Florida I kept talking about how the real estate market was in a bubble &#8211; their gains an illusion.  I pointed to several Economist articles I had read that mapped historical prices of real estate for 400 years and how on average property values grow at no more 1.5% above inflation yet in many markets in the US &amp; Europe prices were rising at 10-25% per year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>&#8220;Yeah, but there is a shortage of supply.  People always want to buy near the water and there is limited supply.  The fundamentals are different now!  You&#8217;re stuck in the past.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ahem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The price of property has an inherent value tied to two factors: 1) the rental rate you could charge for your property and 2) annual salaries in a given geography.  For reason number two people pay a higher price &amp; rent in New York than they do in San Antonio, Texas.  Yes, there are some factors that can affect property prices beyond these two factors (e.g. a high portion of vacation homes or a market changes in demographics such as age) but income (and the employment rate) has the highest correlation in most markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At dinner parties I was wrong for several years but I stuck to my guns.  The numbers just didn&#8217;t make sense to me.  I kept pointing to the artificial gains in the Nasdaq in 1999 and said, &#8220;just because you bought in Feb &#8217;99 and sold in Sept &#8217;99 for a large gain doesn&#8217;t meant the asset was correctly priced.&#8221;  My message to everybody at the time, &#8220;Sell!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And so Buzzkill Suster continues.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The dinner parties now are filled with self-righteous angel investors bragging about how many deals they are in on.  They have marked-up paper gains propped up by an over excited venture capital market that has validated their investments.  For now.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Logic tells me the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is hard to make money angel investing.</strong> I have called it a &#8220;mug&#8217;s game&#8221; and I mostly try to avoid it.  The best angels will do very well just at the best real estate investors did well in good times and bad.  But the masses have now entered the market and everybody fancies themselves an &#8220;angel investor.&#8221;  It is the new calling card.  It is the new cocktail party conversation.  We list it on our bio&#8217;s as bragging rights.  We jockey to make sure the press release has our names on it.  It is slowly becoming Florida Condos.  And it&#8217;s driving up prices beyond their inherent value.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are too many deals</strong>.   For venture capitalists this isn&#8217;t troubling.  Too many angel deals just means more to watch and invest in for the ones that do succeed (if the VCs can get in at reasonable prices).  But all of this increased company creation has to go somewhere.  Arguement one says, &#8220;the world is different now.  It costs less money to start companies so the world should have way more startups.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve heard the &#8220;world is different&#8221; argument in every bubble I&#8217;ve ever seen.  It&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s cheaper to start companies now and cheaper to get distribution.  Most of these companies will not get big enough and earn enough profits to pay big enough salaries for teams.  People only put up with &#8220;ramen profitable&#8221; salaries for so long before they become disenchanted.  Argument two says, &#8220;big companies can&#8217;t innovate anymore so Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc. will continue to buy up this talent as a form of R&amp;D.&#8221;  That is true &#8211; in a booming market like we&#8217;re seeing now.  Remember it was only 2008 where Microsoft and even Google were laying off employees.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many may simply hit the wall.</strong> If the &#8220;forever ramen profitable&#8221; or &#8220;startups as a source of M&amp;A innovation&#8221; arguments don&#8217;t hold then we&#8217;re likely headed for one big brick wall.  That would mean that the increased number of new business startups will lead to a &#8220;funding gap&#8221; of deals that can&#8217;t get financed.  We haven&#8217;t hit that wall yet for three reasons: 1) not enough elapsed time, 2) the VC market is frenzied now, too and 3) we haven&#8217;t seen a market downturn since the volume picked up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great businesses take 7-10 years to build. </strong> People often talk about what makes a great investor.  I always say, &#8220;if you&#8217;re judging actual returns on a 3-year timeframe you&#8217;re looking at mostly failure.  This is the time it takes for a bankruptcy or asset sale to occur.  Or a quick flip.  Any of these scenarios aren&#8217;t great outcomes for investors.&#8221;  The reality is that the &#8220;big winners&#8221; in business that drive extra-ordinary returns often take 7-10 years to materialize.  <a href="http://twitter.com/danmunro" target="_blank">Dan Munro</a> linked to t<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2009/08/25/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-a-technology-empire/" target="_blank">his excellent article in the WSJ</a> in the comments with real data to prove the point.  The problem is that this is longer than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Businesscycle_figure3.jpg" target="_blank">average economic cycle</a>, which means you need to be able to manage in good times and bad.  Bad times often require more capital but ironically this is when capital is dried up.  Bad times are when M&amp;A halts to a trickle and this is when many businesses are rushing to get exits.  If I judge the success of the &#8220;angel boom&#8221; by the last 18 months it is a resounding success &#8211; at least on paper. But I&#8217;ll judge the angel class of 2009/2010 on a 7-10 year time horizon.  We&#8217;ll re-compare notes then.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investors are conformists by nature</strong>.  I believe that huge financial, productivity and technical gains come from new innovation rather than derivative thinking.  This requires novel thinking.  Yet nearly any entrepreneur who has an idea that other people aren&#8217;t doing will tell you that it&#8217;s hard to get investors excited.  Instead investors are looking for the next flash sale, private sale, game dynamic, social games that rely on mobile platforms with geo-fenced, location aware offers.  That is conformity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>People buy at the wrong times.</strong> Most of my <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/09/08/are-mbas-necessary-for-start-ups-or-vc/" target="_blank">MBA classes were a waste</a> (since I had studied economics as an undergrad) but one totally changed my thinking.  It was an investment management class.  The professor showed that there is a big increase in volume of buyers as a market peaks and a big increase in selling as the market is falling.  He said that data suggests people prefer to &#8220;buy high, sell low.&#8221;  And so it goes in tech investing.  I saw VCs doing crazy things in 2007-08 when I first entered the VC market &#8211; crazy prices, limited due diligence, large funding rounds.  I avoided much of this.  in 2009 the market was completely constipated as investors focused on triage.  I was very active in 2009 / early 2010.  The market is <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/11/storm-clouds.html" target="_blank">over-heating again</a> with people chasing deal.  It&#8217;s like &#8220;market amnesia.&#8221;  I must also say that all those angels who hid their checkbooks in 2008/09 are now back with a vengeance and paying higher &amp; higher prices.  Same with VCs.  And now everybody is an angel.  Even people who haven&#8217;t had good exits, gained experience in their careers or have enough deep pockets to last a market downturn fancy themselves as angels.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m skating where I think the puck is going</strong>.  I&#8217;m not giving up on the market completely.  I am avoiding &#8220;frenzied&#8221; deals for all of the reasons <a href="http://twitter.com/infoarbitrage" target="_blank">Roger Ehrenberg</a> talks about in <a href="http://informationarbitrage.com/post/1552977090/investing-in-a-frenzied-market" target="_blank">his excellent blog post</a>.  I&#8217;m trying to pick themes that I think will map to macro trends over the next 5-10 years.  I&#8217;m spending a lot of time looking at video production &amp; distribution because I believe this will form a larger basis of the future Internet and I believe that Hollywood &amp; television will face large, disruptive forces.  Plus, as I live in Los Angeles it is where some of the smartest talent thinking about this space resides.  I&#8217;m looking at how the digital living room will change media consumption.  I continue to be excited about the Mobile Web (as distinct from the Mobile App).  I still love B2B application.  I am really bullish on data-as-a-service.  I will write about some of these topics soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why should you care? </strong></p>
<p>If you raise money from experienced sources &#8211; whether angel, micro-VC or VC &#8211; you will be better served in scenarios when the market corrects, where your large competitors launch hostile offerings or where things end up taking longer than you had expected in order to show progress.  Mine is not an argument for VCs over angels &#8211; it is for sophistication over <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/credulity" target="_blank">credulity</a>.   In boom times anybody&#8217;s money will do.  I&#8217;ve lived through two tech market corrections at close range.  The first money to pack-up and head for the door is always the least knowledgeable / least committed to the long-term of our industry.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3968" title="blank name tag" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/blank-name-tag.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="339" /></p>
<p>It OUGHT to be really obvious how to create a proper tag for a conference, but my observation is that 98% of conferences suck at name tags.  Maybe more.  It makes networking much more difficult / awkward.  And it&#8217;s so damn solvable &#8211; no rocket science degree required.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It completely baffles me, actually.  I would think these suggestions would be a BGO (blinding glimpse of the obvious, for those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym" target="_blank">TLA</a> fans) but I guess not.  If you agree with me, please forward this post to people organizing conferences to save us all the future hassle.</p>
<p><strong>1. If you can, avoid &#8220;hanging&#8221; name tags </strong>- I&#8217;m not a big fan of name tags that hang from your neck.  One reason is that the length is hard to estimate and therefore the tags usually end up somewhere close to your belly.  It is really impractical to try and glance at somebody&#8217;s name / company when it&#8217;s by their belly.  It&#8217;s even more embarrassing if you&#8217;re already supposed to know the person and you&#8217;re looking for a prompt to remember their name or when you&#8217;re trying to figure out the name of a woman.  Bit awkward, hey?</p>
<p>My preference is to have a name tag that has a magnetic device so that each person can attach it to their shirt, blouse, lapel or wherever they want it.  But I guarantee the people will place it higher than the hanging name tag and thus readable.</p>
<p><strong>2. If you have hanging name tags make them two sided </strong>- The magnetic name tags are more expensive so I know some people won&#8217;t opt for them.  If you DO go for hanging name tags, for fuck sake print the names on both sides of the tag.  It seems a universal law that these tags flip over and more than 50% of the time seem not to land on the side with the name.  It&#8217;s so easy to just print two-sided.  If you&#8217;re going to bother having name tags, you want people to read them.  Let&#8217;s just call it &#8220;BothSidesoftheTag.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Make the name big. Really big</strong>. &#8211; And another thing (I&#8217;m feeling a bit like Larry David right now &#8230;) why do people print out name tags and then make the names in a really small font so only 16 year olds can read them?  Names ought to take almost 50% of the space on the name tag.  The whole point is to be able to READ the name tag.  In the same way you don&#8217;t want people to present at a conference with 12 point fonts, why do you print out their name tags with similar sizes?  Go big!</p>
<p><strong>4. Make the company name just as big</strong>. &#8211; And while you&#8217;re at it, make the other 50% say their company name.   Those are the two things every single person who is networking at your event wants to know &#8211; name &amp; company.  Make all of our lives easier.  My personal suggestion is to make the company name a slightly different color so it&#8217;s easier on the eye to distinguish.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don&#8217;t waste space with meaningless information </strong>- I know you want to put your event name really big on the tag.  I understand that urge.  But we&#8217;re already AT your event.  We know it&#8217;s your event.  We chose to come.  We love you already.  Your big logo / name / event description on the name tag is taking away from its functional utility.  It is distracting.  It steals space from the main event.  And we&#8217;re not going to save it as a keepsake after the event, so why bother?  If you must put it, please consider putting it at the bottom and in really small writing.</p>
<p><strong>6. Don&#8217;t have name tags we need to pin to ourselves </strong>- Very few people have these kinds of tags any more.  That&#8217;s great.  This is the worst kind of tag overall for obvious reasons.  It ruins people&#8217;s clothes.  Obvious.</p>
<p><strong>7. Have a thick pen handy </strong>- Finally, there will always be somebody that somehow got left off your list or is conference crashing (i.e. the kind you&#8217;re OK with being there).  Nothing worse than being the only person at a conference with no name tag.</p>
<p><strong>8. Oh, and &#8230;</strong> &#8211; I was prompted by Al in the comments.  We don&#8217;t need all that extra VIP junk where you say if we&#8217;re a speaker, moderator or sponsor on our name tags.  It doesn&#8217;t really make us feel extra special.  It&#8217;s just a distraction.</p>
<p>End of rant.  Get back to work.</p>

<p>The formation of Hulu was defensive – designed to stop another YouTube or Napster from emerging and causing disruption to the TV industry.  The idea was that if you could put up a consumer site that was seen as the best place to consume content then people wouldn’t go to lower-quality or free sites to get it.  The founders felt that having a legitimate site for content would discourage Silicon Valley VC’s from funding entrepreneurs to create the next big TV killer.</p>
<p>This narrative has been confirmed to me by several senior studio executives.  Once this new service became popular then the media companies could control the rules of distribution &amp; advertising.</p>
<p>To say that the tech elite were cynical of Hulu&#8217;s launch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/03/23/what-we-know-so-far-about-newtube-isnt-good/" target="_blank">would be an understatement</a>, but by the time it launched just a few months later it was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2007/10/28/hulu-launches-private-beta-first-impressions-very-good/" target="_blank">getting great reviews</a>.</p>
<p>I have personally always felt a sort of cognitive dissonance regarding Hulu.  I have always loved watching videos there but always believed that any company controlled by a consortia of interests would be doomed in the long run &#8211; especially by established, large incumbents with an interest in protecting the past more than innovating the future.  I have made many of my arguments in a blog post I wrote on <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/11/04/understanding-how-the-innovators-dilemma-affects-you/" target="_blank">The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</a>, a concept that is critical for both innovators &amp; incumbents to understand.</p>
<p>When I recently wrote about how excited I was about investing in &#8220;<a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/10/19/the-future-of-television-the-digital-living-room/" target="_blank">The Digital Living Room</a>,&#8221; Hulu was only mentioned in the context of how <a href="http://www.clicker.com/" target="_blank">Clicker.com</a> was a much better metaphor for content discovery and search.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with OPEC?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC" target="_blank">OPEC</a> (the organization of petroleum exporting countries) is a cartel that was set up in the 1960&#8242;s and represents the interests of the 12 biggest oil producing countries in the world with the goal of increasing prices of oil, a good supplied in limited quantities to a world that had insatiable demand for the product.  The philosophy of OPEC has been that if they can limit the amount of oil supplied to the world they can maintain high prices in a world where demand and competition should naturally have downward pressure on oil prices.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu" target="_blank">Hulu</a> is an online video distribution system owned by 3 of the largest 5 film &amp; television suppliers in the United States with the goal of limiting the supply of high-quality online video available in order to defend high prices of the supply of this content on televisions through cable, satellite &amp; broadcast TV.</p>
<p>Both systems are threatened in the medium run because alternative supplies of their products will become more plentiful.</p>
<p>The goal of any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel" target="_blank">cartel</a> is to control production, distribution &amp; marketing of a set of goods with the goal of maintaining high prices.  Because they are anti-competitive most countries ban cartels.  The problem with OPEC, as in most cartels, is that the incentive for any individual suppliers is to &#8220;cheat&#8221; the system by going around restrictions.  If all other countries are reducing supply &amp; holding high prices then you benefit by producing more yourself or secretly distributing to people who will pay higher prices.  This has been the history of OPEC &#8211; it a cartel full of countries that routinely have cheated.</p>
<p>Oil is a commodity with which the world has a love / hate relationship.  We love the productivity and independence that comes from oil powering our machinery &amp; transportation but we hate enriching producers that we feel sometimes act against our best interests as consumers.</p>
<p>So it is quite lofty to compare hulu with OPEC.  Here is my case:</p>
<p><strong>1. Restricted Supply:</strong> We love the content that is produced by the companies that are the primary suppliers to hulu: Modern Family, The Office, The Simpsons or even classics such as Arrested Development.  But Hulu isn&#8217;t as good as we&#8217;d like it to be because the supply is held back.  Current shows generally only have 5 episodes at a time, which makes the service pretty mediocre as far as consumer value goes.  Older shows might allow a single season.</p>
<p>Why the limitation?  Many reasons but a clue is that the studios have to honor &#8220;time windows&#8221; for when the show runs.  They monetize via high-priced advertisements during the prime-time airing on TV, via syndication to international audiences or less-watched channels after the original series has run and via DVD sales in retail channels.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s their right to do so and there is so much money involved you can hardly blame them.  But this Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma restricts them from having as useful of a service as they otherwise might.  <a href="http://www.hulu.com/plus" target="_blank">Hulu Plus</a> now allows you to get a more extensive &#8220;catalog&#8221; for $10 / month.  It has just been released to wide audiences November 2010 &#8211; mostly in response to the growing popularity of Netflix and ironically the introduction of the ABC.com player on the iPad.</p>
<p><strong>2. Limited &#8220;Targeting&#8221; of Advertisements</strong>:  The great promise of the Internet for advertisers was that they were finally going to be able to deliver targeted advertisements to users because they could finally know who you were.  This has become a reality with banner ads, search ads, contextual ads and Facebook ads.  But not Hulu ads.</p>
<p>Why?  They know who we are, don&#8217;t they?  Yes, they do.  But they generally don&#8217;t even allow advertisers to purchase ads for a single show let alone ads targeting YOU by reading your cookies on your computer.  So we have ads that are even less targeted than those on television.  The reason lies in protecting the high price of broadcast &amp; cable advertising rates.  They are nervous about &#8220;trading analog dollars for digital pennies.&#8221;  So advertisers have to buy &#8220;run of site&#8221; ads rather than show specific ones.</p>
<p><strong>3. Cheating:</strong> As I pointed out cartels create the incentive to cheat because each individual supplier gains by cheating if everybody in the system doesn&#8217;t.  In oil that is a country secretly producing more than their allowed rate limits.  In Hulu it is each individual studio / network wanting to push their own stuff direct rather than through Hulu.  I might talk openly about how Hulu is my partner, while simultaneously <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/04/13/abc-sees-success-in-ipad-app/" target="_blank">launching an iPad player before hulu does</a> (as ABC did) &#8211; even when I&#8217;m a shareholder.</p>
<p>Each of the major media shareholders maintain their own websites where they can (and do) promote their content directly and have every incentive to do so.  As I&#8217;ve always argued, if Fox were to create another hit show as popular at &#8220;American Idol&#8221; it is hard for me to imagine that they wouldn&#8217;t run exclusive content &amp; promotions on their own site more than on Hulu, where they&#8217;re a smaller partner.</p>
<p><strong>4. Slow innovation:</strong> When Hulu launched I think it&#8217;s fair to say that it exceeded nearly everybody&#8217;s expectations.  The website was easy-to-use, fast, clean and gave us access to the good stuff.  Yet for all the fanfare at launch and despite its popularity as a website to consume video content I would argue that its pace of innovation has been slower than its initial launch might have suggested.</p>
<p>If you want to search for video content on the Internet it&#8217;s far easier / more useful to do on Clicker.com than on Hulu &#8211; even for content that is offered on their site!  Hulu emerged in the social networking era and yet Boxee has been way out in front in terms of creating social viewing experiences.  We are seeing the emergence of the &#8220;digital living room&#8221; and yet Netflix, Apple &amp; Google all seem to be better positioned to have a seat at our couches.  We are entering the age of &#8220;second screen&#8221; TV viewing.  We are really still in the first inning of this trend but it is not being led by Hulu.  They were late to the iPad and late with a subscription service.</p>
<p>At times the innovation has actually worked in reverse and not just a stand still.  As consumers we all want to get content streamed to our television sets in addition to our PCs and iPads.  Boxee was created to give us this experience.  And as the service started to gain popularity it created an integration with Hulu to allow Boxee users to watch what was already free on the Internet on their television sets.  Yet Hulu blocked the integration and wouldn&#8217;t allow Boxee to stream Hulu on the TV.  Even though any of us could just plug our PC&#8217;s / Macs into our TV sets ourselves (or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqdH15iOojQ" target="_blank">with a little help from YouTube instructions</a>), Hulu wanted to block this.</p>
<p>Why?  Because the MSOs (cable &amp; satellite providers) don&#8217;t really want to see you watching Internet videos on your TV set.  This kind of viewing, called &#8220;over the top,&#8221; is what is leading many households to cancel their expensive cable packages.  When you can already watch Jon Stewart, Saturday Night Live, all the news shows, The View and everything else on the computer it seems like live sports, ESPN and HBO are some of the last vestiges of content keeping many from cutting their cords today.</p>
<p>And yet I imagine that this lack of innovation must irritate nobody more than the CEO of Hulu, Jason Kilare.  His launch at Hulu was so successful and we all started believing that maybe he could really just pull this thing off.  But I suspect he, and the rest of Hulu, are starting to discover the Faustian bargain of having the big media suppliers as large shareholders in a world where startups or other tech companies get to play by their own rules.  If you haven&#8217;t read Ken Auletta&#8217;s brilliant book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Googled-End-World-As-Know/dp/1594202354" target="_blank">Googled</a>, you should.  Amongst other things it chronicles the frustration many media companies have had in not being able to play by the same rules as the tech companies.</p>
<p>They seem to have such a talented team over at Hulu and yet seem held back from the best that they could produce.  <span style="font-size: 13.2px;">As NBC (founding shareholder at Hulu) and Comcast complete their merger I suspect the pressure on and control of Hulu will be even firmer.</span></p>
<p><strong>5. The Road Ahead?</strong> Hulu hinted at greatness.  They clearly have a very talented management team yet are clearly held back by the Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma from their shareholders that binds them.  They raised $100 million from Providence Equity Partners at a $1 billion valuation and have thus proven that they understand that a degree of independence is vital for their success.</p>
<p>If I were a corporate shareholder at Hulu I would &#8220;set them free&#8221; even further.  I would reduce contractual obligations that bind them to your archaic industry norms.  I would reduce my equity stake much further.  I would take a lower valuation in exchange for bringing in world-class investors that can create the right structure for future success.</p>
<p>Disney has already shown it has innovation potential on its own in the tech meets media world and being too tied to Hulu will only continue to create inconsistencies.  Fox has already divested much of FAN (the Fox Audience Network) and has been wanting to sell MySpace for some time.  NBC will merge with Comcast, owner of &#8220;Fancast,&#8221; which would be a competitive offering to Hulu.  I think all of these players are better off reducing their ties to Hulu while driving their own innovation in house.</p>
<p>The model I would look to?  Skype.  It languished under the ownership of eBay who didn&#8217;t have the right vision or structure to take Skype to the next level.  The current executive team at eBay are not the ones that bought the company and thus were able to create a deal that brings the right incentives to spin-out Skype.  But they didn&#8217;t just sell it and take the cash.  They held on to a minority stake and brought in people like Andreessen Horowitz to help create a more valuable asset in the long-run for their reduced stake.</p>
<p>I would much rather be a big media company with a smaller stake in a video company that transforms the industry than a larger shareholder in one that does not.  Obvious.</p>
<p>One day television &amp; film are going to be disrupted and the opportunities for monetization by those that understand the future will be immense.  In the current structure I cannot see how Hulu becomes this company.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Revolutionary-Business-Essentials/dp/0060521996"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3986" title="Innovators Dilemma Book" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Innovators-Dilemma-Book.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="280" /></a>Many people bandy about the definitions of &#8220;disruptive technology&#8221; or &#8220;the innovator&#8217;s dilemma&#8221; without ever having read the book and almost universally misunderstand the concepts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let me start with Professor Christensen&#8217;s definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>&#8220;An innovation that is disruptive allows a <strong>whole new population of consumers </strong>access to a product or service that was historically only accessible to consumers with a lot of money or a lot of skill.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Professor Christensen uses real data from the disk drive industry to make his points.  Reading it felt like read a university book for an economics class and no wonder since he&#8217;s a professor at Harvard Business School.  It is not a beach novel to be sure.  The framework of his book has profoundly altered how I think about the technology market and affects how I thought about building my businesses and how I think about investing in venture capital.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The thesis of the book is that incumbents in markets &#8211; especially large and well entrenched markets &#8211; seldom survive fundamental technology changes in their industries.  In a world where we&#8217;ve seen newspapers crumbling, record labels struggling and Blockbuster imploding and making way for the rise of Netflix it seems kinda intuitive to most of us but we can&#8217;t quite place why this happens.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But understanding the framework rather than just thinking &#8220;those dumb fucks don&#8217;t get it&#8221; is very useful for thinking about how markets evolve.  It should affect how you think if you are an incumbent but also if you&#8217;re a startup.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s start with the incumbents position in a market.  I&#8217;ve characterized it in a chart below.  It is often the situation that the incumbent offers a product that is vastly superior in the market in terms of performance or functionality.  This is important because the customers they serve (the red line) demand a product that meets their complex requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Think of incumbent line as Siebel and the red line as the large enterprise customers that they served who demanded 1,800 features and sent out RFPs with checklists that had to be ticked off to even be in the running for their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Innovators-Dilemma1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3987" title="Innovator's Dilemma" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Innovators-Dilemma1.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="299" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When new companies enter the market they really have no chance to initially unseat the incumbents because the performance gap is too large and the costs / time of catching up too unachievable.  In fact, the incumbent is usually very dismissive of this new competition as our the large buyers of the incumbent&#8217;s products.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And weirdly the buyers of this technology often have a vested interest in buying from the incumbent.  They see it as a source of differentiation for them as a company because their less financed competitors can&#8217;t afford it (and often their careers are wrapped up in the multi-millions of dollars they&#8217;ve spent implementing it).  In short, they ain&#8217;t just gonna throw that away for some new fangled tech toy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So the startups tend to focus on totally new customers.  They try to capture people that didn&#8217;t buy the expensive stuff in the first place because they couldn&#8217;t afford it.  Often the startups are actually serving a slightly different kind of customer or a slightly different market need.  The thing about &#8220;disruptive&#8221; technology as I interpret it is NOT that it is a major breakthrough in performance or functionality as most people conceive it.  It is often LESS performant.  What is &#8220;disruptive&#8221; is that is also dramatically less expensive.  And the providers take a much lower margin &#8211; they have nothing to lose, nothing to protect.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enter Salesforce.com.  In 1999-2000 they weren&#8217;t doing enterprise-wide installations at Merrill Lynch, Dell and Cisco.  That would have been laughable.  They were serving a latent market need for mid-sized businesses to use CRM.  They offered a product that didn&#8217;t even try to compare with Siebel.  In fact, they tried to totally redefine the market.  &#8221;Siebel cost you $2 million and 18 months to implement?  How about $30,000 and 3 weeks?&#8221;  They didn&#8217;t exactly grap the top end of the market.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what did happen?  And what does happen in many other industries?  First, over time Salesforce.com&#8217;s technology got better and better yet the price didn&#8217;t shoot up dramatically relative to Siebel.  And after a few years enterprise customers started looking at the cost disparity and saying, &#8220;maybe Salesforce.com is good enough to meet our requirements?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Incumbents feel threatened.  Often their response isn&#8217;t to radically cut cost and try to hold on to customers.  They can&#8217;t.  They have big installed bases.  They have existing customers who already paid big prices who would be seriously pissed off if the next guy bought the same thing for 10x less.  The incumbents have expensive product features to maintain and often expensive sales channels.  Think Compaq when Dell first went direct over the phone then Internet.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And if the incumbent did dramatically cut costs all they would seemingly do is start following the lead of the new entrant?  There you have the innovator&#8217;s dilemma.  The incumbents curse.  You can&#8217;t take a $5 billion revenue stream and say &#8220;Fuck it.  They&#8217;re going to eat our lunch anyways &#8211; let&#8217;s just cut our revenue to $1.5 billion and wipe &#8216;em out.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So they do the opposite.  The increase spending on features / performance / functionality.  They gather with their cadre of high-requirement customers and have planning sessions about how they can make even more performant products.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But here&#8217;s the thing.  Often customer requirements don&#8217;t grow exponentially relative to their existing line.  And as you trace the red line in the graph above as it gets closer and closer over time to the new entrants functional offering there is a huge and rapid sucking sound that pulls the bottom out of the market as waves of customers &#8220;trade down.&#8221;  And Salesforce.com becomes a $15 billion company doing $1.2 billion in recurring run-rate revenue and growing while <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siebel_Systems" target="_blank">Siebel is sold to Oracle for a mere $5.8 billion</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The take aways for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The incumbent eventually realizes what is happening to them.  They are run by smart &amp; shrewd people or they wouldn&#8217;t become leaders in incumbent organizations in the first place</li>
<li>They are blinded for too long &#8211; reinforced by big revenues &amp; profits that come from customers that corroborate their misinformed views of the future because they have a shared &amp; vested stake in status quo</li>
<li>Disruptive technologies are often those the are less performant and feel &#8220;<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chintzy" target="_blank">chintzey</a>&#8221; relative to their well-heeled competitors.  They are radically lower in price.  They initially create deflationary pressures in a market.  They are nearly impossible to react to.  But while the price points are dramatically lower this often encourages more users, more innovation in the eco-system and therefore often a bigger market opportunity than even the incumbents perceived</li>
<li>I am reminded about how dismissive traditionally television media is about YouTube &#8211; even to this day.  About how dismissive traditional print was about blogs or the airlines views the &#8220;peanut serving&#8221; Southwest Airlines.  About how Microsoft viewed Google Apps.  Sony, the iPod.  US automakers made the mistake with the &#8220;low end&#8221; Japanese manufactures until the Toyota became the Lexus.  What future have telcos for call-based revenue in the era of Skype?</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that Clay Christensen has written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578518520?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=claytonchrist-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1578518520" target="_blank">a book that proposes solutions for incumbents</a>.  I haven&#8217;t read it.  Maybe I should.  But anecdotal evidence tells me that incumbents eventually struggle to massively disrupt their own large and profitable businesses &#8211; that change has got to come from outside.  Some have tried to artificially create &#8220;innovation labs&#8221; from within but I struggle to believe that this model will work for disruption.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best they can do is to help fund their successors.  Perhaps they can spawn the next generation of innovators and leave a footprint of their DNA along the way.  Or at least diversify the future fortunes of their shareholders in the way that Yahoo! earned handsomely from Google&#8217;s success.  I don&#8217;t know &#8211; it may not be intellectually or emotionally possible.</p>
<p>But if I studied every incumbent industry around me and saw the destruction that technology and the Internet was bringing I would at least want to have an ownership stake in my pillager&#8217;s future cashflows if I knew the sacking of the castle was inevitable.</p>
