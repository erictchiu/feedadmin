Ah, college. I digress &mdash; back to that mammoth 30-inch Dell that educated all of its owners on what dual-link DVI meant. I sold it just a few months later and downgraded to a 24-inch display. Why you ask? I thought it was too frickin&#8217; huge! The person I sold it to sold it a few weeks later; he thought it was large as well! I loved the resolution but hated having to move my head around to see the other side of the screen. Maybe my desk at the time wasn&#8217;t deep enough and I sat too close. But now I&#8217;m ready. Ready to try another huge display. <span id="more-7590"></span></p>

Currently the only LED-backlit 27-inch display capable of 2560&#215;1440 resolution. Dell&#8217;s comparable 27-incher is more expensive and has a CCFL backlight. Yeah, you read correctly. An Apple product that is actually <em>cheaper</em> than a similar Dell product. This should be interesting.</p>
<h4>Unboxing</h4>
<p>Thanks to Amazon Prime, I ordered the display and received it two days later. While the display retails for $999, it was only $950 on Amazon (or you can use a student account to purchase it for $950 directly from Apple).</p>

<h4>Setup &#038; First Impressions</h4>
<p>I ended up placing my MacBook Pro on top of the display&#8217;s stand and was fairly pleased with this setup. I had tried placing the laptop under my desk on top of a bookshelf but the cord is barely long enough (which makes me wonder how Mac Pro users deal with having their computer on the floor and away from the display) and the bluetooth connection to the mouse started acting up and got jittery. </p>

<p><strong>The display didn&#8217;t take over my desk.</strong> It didn&#8217;t feel overly large and only took a few minutes to get used to compared to using my 17-inch MacBook Pro. Looking straight ahead at the display is <strong>much more natural</strong> than looking down and bending over the laptop. Turning on the display for the first time, I was quickly able to discern it was LED backlit. It instantly came on and full brightness could be achieved easily. CCFL backlit LCD displays take noticeably longer to reach your desired brightness level upon powering it up. My old Dell 2407WFP-HC was like that.</p>
<p>There is no OSD for settings and no controls <em>of any sort</em> on the monitor itself. Not even a power switch. Everything, including brightness, is controlled by Mac OS X. If you are hooking this display up to a PC you will need to install <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/" title="Boot Camp - Apple">Boot Camp</a> (even if you are not actually in a dual-boot Boot Camp setup).</p>

<p>The 27-inch Apple Cinema Display is a comparatively thin display but has a slightly thicker bezel than I would like. The USB ports in the back are somewhat handy, but plugging stuff in there without craning your neck around is kind of a blind fumble around. Fortunately, I don&#8217;t have many devices to plug in.</p>

<p>The integrated 2.1 49-watt stereo speaker system won&#8217;t replace <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-upgrade-to-studio-monitor-speakers" title="How To Upgrade to Studio Monitor Speakers">your studio monitors</a> and lack any sort of high-volume punch. It doesn&#8217;t help that the speakers are down-firing.</p>

<p>Alas, they are satisfactory for most purposes. I watched several movies with the integrated speakers, with me sitting about 8 feet away. The volume was at about 90-95% to be able to clearly hear voices in the movies. I did discover a sound issue though. The speakers cease working if you disconnect them while the display is on then try to reconnect them. They only continue working after you completely unplug the computer from the display then reattach it. More on that issue on <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2611014&#038;start=0&#038;tstart=0" title="Topic : 27" Cinema Display Sound Issues">the Apple Discussion support forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Apple display affords you no fancy adjustability settings. Just a slight up/down tilt (-5 to 25 degrees). That&#8217;s the one thing I hated about my old 24-inch iMac; I couldn&#8217;t adjust the height. I ended up getting a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/review-ilift-vesa-arm" title="Review: iLift VESA Arm">hydraulic VESA arm</a> for that. The Apple 27-inch display&#8217;s height doesn&#8217;t seem to bother me much yet though I do not comfortably see the top of the display at eye level (what I keep hearing to be the ergonomic preferred setup). I might end up lowering my desk by an inch.</p>
<h4>Not for Professionals</h4>
<p>Despite the high-end price tag, this display is <em><strong>not for professionals</strong></em>. This is for people that appreciate the Apple aesthetic, the convenience of having an integrated MacBook charger in the display, require an integrated webcam and/or those that do not care about the color profile much and would rather benefit from deep blacks associated with a glossy display while watching movies and other such video content. While LED backlit displays have perks like lower power consumption and &#8220;instant on&#8221; backlighting, the particular setup in this Apple display is a step down from CCFL backlight setups, such as that found in the Dell U2711. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you why. Apple cheaped out and used white LEDs for the backlight (actually a blue LED with a yellow phosphor coating) rather than RGB LEDs. This <strong>negatively affects the color gamut</strong> of the display. CCFL backlights or RGB LEDs are better with regards to color reproduction for LCD displays, with the latter being rather expensive at the moment. RGB LEDs as a backlight actively adjust the temperature of the white produced. White LEDs on the other hand lack much in the green and red department, which is why professionals deem the Apple 27-inch Cinema Display as having a slight blue tint without performing proper color calibration first. I believe it might be more common to begin seeing displays with WLEDs and local dimming in the near future than a ubiquity of RGB LED backlight displays. Local dimming doesn&#8217;t fix the gamut issue associated with WLEDs but helps boost contrast.</p>

<p>Moving on, the ACD uses an 8-bit panel. The CCFL backlit Dell U2711 also uses an 8-bit panel but with FRC (Frame Rate Control) &mdash; temporal dithering that quickly flips between two shades to simulate shades beyond the native capabilities of the 8-bit panel (only supported by certain video cards). If this all makes sense, you&#8217;ll probably be more interested in the Dell 27-inch display, the 10-bit Dell U3011 or something in the HP DreamColor line if you can really justify the cost.</p>

<h4>Glare</h4>
<p>The display glass is a (fingerprint attracting) thing of beauty but is surely the <strong>largest point of contention</strong> with the display. My MacBook Pro has a matte screen and I love it. Glossy, glare-creating desktop monitors are much harder to use than glossy laptop displays because you simply can&#8217;t move the display easily to adjust the glare. That being said I have oriented the lights in my room to either come from behind the display or way off to the side, but never directly behind me as that causes the most glare. Though I&#8217;m afraid that most people will not have the ability to adjust their room lighting easily, such as those working in an office with fixed fluorescent lighting. If that is the case, you will want to avoid this display. At full bore, the glare is really unbearable at anything but maximum display brightness. </p>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<p>I purchased this display to get more resolution out of my MacBook Pro while cleaning up the nest of cables on my desk. Now that I don&#8217;t have to use my charger when at my desk I can keep it bundled up and ready to go in my backpack. I use Skype video chat frequently so the integrated iSight was a must. And when I have some downtime (heh, rarely) I use the display to watch movies as I don&#8217;t have a TV. That&#8217;s why I actually like the glossy display. The lack of other video inputs limits how I can use the display. Only my MacBook Pro has Mini DisplayPort. Otherwise I will have to purchase something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LGOWNQ?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B003LGOWNQ&#038;tag=paulstamatiou-20" title="Kanex XD HDMI to Mini DisplayPort Converter for 27 inch iMac and LED Cinema Display">Kanex XD</a> if I want to attach an HDMI device like a Vudu box (and even then it will only support 720p over the connection).</p>
<p> I must say that when Apple announced this display I was actually shocked it was <em>only</em> $999. I could have seen Apple easily charging $1,399. The <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043GCBU4?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B0043GCBU4&#038;tag=paulstamatiou-20" title="Apple LED Cinema Display 27-Inch MC007LL/A">Apple 27-inch LED Cinema Display</a></strong> is not among the highest performers but it is one of the only 27-inch displays capable of 2560-by-1440 resolution and by far the sleekest display on the market. I find the size to be perfect and am quite happy with it. I give it <strong>8 out of 10 Stammys</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts? What is your current computer/display setup like? Glossy or matte? Would you consider a large glossy display like this?</strong></p>

These concerns are becoming more prevalent as mainstream laptops are more often coming out with SSDs as standard &mdash; take the new MacBook Air as an example<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>1</sup></a>. Today I just wanted to post a brief update about how my particular SSD setup has been doing just about 9 months after I wrote about the process: <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-apple-macbook-pro-raid-0-array-with-2-intel-x25-m-ssds" title="How To: Apple MacBook Pro RAID 0 Array with 2 Intel X25-M SSDs">How To: Apple MacBook Pro RAID 0 Array with 2 Intel X25-M SSDs</a></strong>. <span id="more-7568"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep this short. <strong>The dual X25-M SSDs are not as fast as they were on day 1</strong>. When the RAID 0 array was brand new I was seeing average reads (for 1MB+ benchmarks) of 520 MB/second and average writes of around 170 MB/s. <strong>Now those numbers are more like 460 MB/second for reads and 150 MB/sec for writes</strong>. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &mdash; still very fast but it definitely looks like they have been put through their paces, especially usually with just 10 GB of free space, and have taken a performance hit. The X25-M&#8217;s controller is smart and controls write amplification with a DRAM buffer so that the drive will reduce NAND flash write operations until most efficient &mdash; waiting until the minimum block size is ready to be written rather than write a whole 128KB for just 4KB of real data. But that can only help so much. </p>
<p>In particular, it appears different parts of the array (which could mean certain parts on one physical drive or the other are more worn out) have heavily varying performance. It only starts to normalize with larger file size benchmarks. The peak performance is still lacking from when the array was new.</p>

</ul>
<p>Just something to keep in mind when you upgrade to a new SSD setup. I would not trust the drive/array for 5 years (MTBF). I already backup a lot considering the controller on my first SSD (an original X25-M G1; ones used in this array are G2s) died after 9 months of usage. In the case of the new MacBook Air, getting AppleCare might actually be worth it so that you can have Apple replace the SSD in a few years after it starts acting up or dies.</p>
<p>And it goes without saying: each few months a better SSD with a smarter controller comes out that will last longer and carryout native TRIM functionality with a supported OS (not OS X), so they will last much longer. If you&#8217;re looking at an SSD today I would probably suggest the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Crucial_C300_SSD" title="Crucial C300 128GB SSD">Crucial C300</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts? What&#8217;s your main machine and does it have an SSD in it?</strong></p>
<p>(I have reached out to an SSD expert to get his thoughts on this.)</p>
<p><strong id="footnotes">Footnotes</strong><br />
<sup>1</sup> I rather dislike when many tech journalists claimed the new MacBook Air was ridiculously fast.. when they compared it to a hard drive toting MacBook Pro. At least compare it to an SSD-equipped MBP! It&#8217;s rather obvious the Air is going to be the first SSD-equipped computer many consumers ever touch.</p>

It started in 2006 during my Yahoo! internship when I used an RSA SecurID token &mdash; my first brush with two-factor authentication. A few weeks ago Google released a small feature that made my ears perk up: <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=180744" title="Google accounts - About two-step verification: Overview">two-step verification</a></strong>. It is currently only available for certain Google Apps account types: Premier, Education, or Government Edition. Previously, the security conscious could only get two-factor authentication with their <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/two-factor-authentication-google-apps-gheimdall" title="How to add two-factor authentication to Google Apps for your Domain using open source software">Google Apps account with a custom software setup</a>: Google Apps SSO with WiKID Server and a Gheimdall plugin. The new <strong><a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=180744" title="About two-step verification: Overview">Google Apps Two-Step Verification</a></strong> addition makes that custom setup a thing of the past. <span id="more-7531"></span></p>
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Why does two-step verification make me ecstatic? You&#8217;ve no doubt read those security nightmare stories over the years. Some malevolent-minded person gets access to a victim&#8217;s Gmail account then searches for things like GoDaddy email confirmations, past transactions, passwords and so on. They can even setup email forwarding to their email address so the victim would never know security had been breached<a href="#footnotes"  rel="nofollow"><sup>1</sup></a>. In less than 24 hours, the attacker can have gained access to dozens of other accounts owned by the victim, changed domain name ownership and more. Many peoples&#8217; entire online lives center around their precious Gmail account. </p>
<p>While this new feature is largely aimed at businesses looking to migrate corporate email and tools to the Google Apps suite while maintaining the familiar and secure two-factor auth configuration, it is definitely welcomed by power users as well. In fact, it will be offered on all Gmail accounts within the next few months (according to TechCrunch).</p>
<p><strong>Related:</strong> Google just released a handy <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/static.py?page=checklist.cs&#038;tab=29488" title="Gmail Security Checklist">Gmail security checklist</a>.</p>
<h4>What?</h4>
<p>Two-factor authentication adds one more barrier to entry for people looking to gain access to your Google Apps account. After the regular password login, the user is prompted for a second &#8220;password.&#8221; This is not a user-set password, but rather a generated and time-sensitive code from a token device (in this case, your mobile phone). </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gapps_twofactor_login.png" alt="Google Apps Two-Step Verification" title="Google Apps Two-Step Verification"/><br/><small>Google Apps Two-Step Verification &#8211; This is displayed after providing your regular password.</small></div>
<blockquote><p>Two-factor authentication typically is a signing-on process where a person proves his or her identity with two of the three methods: &#8220;something you know&#8221; (e.g., password or PIN), &#8220;something you have&#8221; (e.g., smartcard or token), or &#8220;something you are&#8221; (e.g., fingerprint or iris scan).</p></blockquote>
<p>Everything you ever wanted to know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication" title="Two-factor authentication - Wikipedia">two-factor authentication can be found at Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>Since Two-Step Verification is a new feature for Google Apps rather than only Google Apps Gmail, it must be enabled in the actual Google Apps admin panel. Login at https://www.google.com/a/yourdomain.com, or simply click <strong>Manage this domain</strong> within Gmail. Once you are in the Google Apps admin panel, browse to the <strong>Advanced tools</strong> tab and scroll down to the <strong>Authentication</strong> section. Click the <strong>Allow users to turn on two-factor authentication</strong> checkbox.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gapps_adv_tools_twofactor_fix.png" alt="Enable two-step verification in Google Apps" title="Enable two-step verification in Google Apps"/><br/><small>Enable two-step verification in Google Apps</small></div>
<p>Two-step verification is now available for users under that Google Apps domain to setup themselves in their Gmail. Visit your Google Apps Gmail account settings and go to the <strong>Accounts</strong> tab. Click the <strong>Google Account settings</strong> link at the bottom. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gmail_acct_settings_1000.png" title="Google Apps Gmail - Access Google Account Settings"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gmail_acct_settings.png" alt="Google Apps Gmail - Access Google Account Settings"/></a><br/><small>Google Apps Gmail &#8211; Access Google Account Settings</small></div>
<p>On the next page, click <strong>Change sign-in verification</strong> and open it in a new browser tab. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_goog_security_settings.png" alt="Google Account Security Settings" title="Google Account Security Settings"/><br/><small>Google Account Security Settings</small></div>
<p>Then select the radio button for &#8220;Two-step verification, by password and verification code (sent via SMS, phone call, or mobile application).&#8221;</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gapps_setup_twofactor_800.png" title="Google Apps Account Sign-in verification setup"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gapps_setup_twofactor.png" alt="Google Apps Account Sign-in verification setup"/></a><br/><small>Click to see complete screenshot for mobile app and SMS/phone call settings</small></div>
<p>Sections will appear for configuring your mobile application, phone as well as something called single-use codes. If you have an Android device, iPhone or BlackBerry smartphone, you will probably opt for configuring the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=1037451" title="Google Authenticator">Google Authenticator</a> mobile application. Alternatively, you may wish to have Google call or send a text message so that you don&#8217;t have to find and launch the Google Authenticator app amongst your billion other mobile apps. </p>
<blockquote><p>Google Authenticator is a mobile application that allows you to generate two-step verification codes on your smartphone without a network connection. We recommend users with smartphones to use <a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#038;answer=1037451" title="Google Authenticator">Google Authenticator</a> to generate verification codes instantly to sign in to their Google Apps accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>I configured both but only the last one I configured (the mobile app) remained active, despite the Sign-in verification page showing both methods as properly configured and not hinting as to which one takes priority. I would suggest setting up the mobile app if you can. You might find yourself in a foreign country at an Internet cafe where your phone does not have service and you need to pass two-step verification to access your Google Apps Gmail. </p>
<p>Then again, you can always use a lifeline in a rare case like that. Err, I mean <em>single-use code</em>. Google provides all two-step verification enabled users with <strong>a set of codes that may be used as your verification code just once</strong>. Keep these numbers within reach for emergencies but don&#8217;t keep them too handy. The truly paranoid won&#8217;t keep these single-use codes in a digital format &mdash; perhaps printed off and stored in a bank safe deposit box. Or elsewhere if they don&#8217;t trust the government<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>2</sup></a>. Actually, the truly paranoid don&#8217;t use Google Apps, but I digress.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gapps_twofactor_via_mobile.png" alt="Receiving verification code for Google Apps Two-Step Verification via SMS and via mobile Google Authenticator app" title="Receiving verification code for Google Apps Two-Step Verification via SMS and via mobile Google Authenticator app"/><br/><small>Two (of three) ways to receive verification code for Google Apps Two-Step Verification: via SMS and generating a code with the Google Authenticator mobile app</small></div>
<h4>What are Access Codes?</h4>
<p>How do you give access to your Google Apps account for desktop and mobile applications that don&#8217;t have a field for the verification code? In place of your regular password, you provide that application with an access code. It&#8217;s like a one-off password for just that application. Get started by clicking <strong>Change authorized websites</strong> from the account settings page you originally loaded from Gmail settings.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gapps_access_codes_1000.png" title="Google Apps account - access codes and website access"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gapps_access_codes.png" alt="Google Apps account - access codes and website access"/></a><br/><small>Google lists websites you have authorized to have access to your account, as well as letting you manage access codes for each service/application.</small></div>
<p>Simply create a new access code by providing a descriptive title so you can keep track of it later. Then copy that code and supply it to the application or service for which you made it. An example might be your desktop mail client that accesses Google Apps Gmail via IMAP. The downside is that you will have to let your computer save this access code (or remember a very long and entropic code). It&#8217;s not something you can just type in only when you feel like accessing that service, like logging into Google Talk and typing in your password each time.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gapps_access_code_create.png" title="Creating Access Code for Google Apps Two-Step Verification" alt="Creating Access Code for Google Apps Two-Step Verification"/><br/><small>Creating a new access code</small></div>
<p>The upside is that you can easily revoke access to your account for that application if that particular computer or device becomes compromised &mdash; without all the hassle associated with having to change your password and subsequently update it on all your Internet-connected devices. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pstam_gapps_twofactor_revoke.png" alt="Revoke access code for Google Apps Two-step verification"/><br/><small>Easily revoke any access code.</small></div>
<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<p>I think I have sufficiently covered the basics of what Google&#8217;s new two-step verification feature is about, why you might want to consider enabling it and everything else you need to know to get it all setup. <strong>If you have any questions, please let me know in a comment below.</strong> Two-step verification for certain Google Apps accounts (and surely more in the near future) is a welcomed addition. It is not the world&#8217;s most bulletproof solution <a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>3</sup></a> but it is definitely much better than a regular password-protected account. Even better if you use it in conjunction with a crazy password<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p><strong>But won&#8217;t this be annoying to do every time I need to check my Gmail?</strong><br />
On your personal computer you will likely check the &#8220;Remember verification for this computer&#8221; checkbox when logging in, which gives you 30 days of access without having to provide the verification code again (barring any browser resets)<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I give Google Apps Two-Step Verification <strong>9 out of 10 Stammys</strong>. It would be higher if other tokens were allowed. Relying strictly on a mobile device is great because everyone already has one but they can too easily be lost, stolen or bricked (botched iPhone jail-breaking anyone?). There&#8217;s a good chance that if someone&#8217;s laptop bag is stolen, their mobile phone will be right there with it. Keychain-based tokens, not so much. Adding support for USB tokens or SecurID/CryptoCard tokens would be the next natural step, especially as Google Apps is primarily targeted towards the enterprise.  Just my 2 cents.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts? Will you enable two-step verification when your Google Apps or Gmail account gets it?</strong></p>
<p><strong id="footnotes">Footnotes</strong><br />
<sup>1</sup> It doesn&#8217;t help that Google&#8217;s whole marketing pitch with Gmail is that you&#8217;ll never have to delete email again because of all the storage space. </p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Authorities in the U.S. can access safe deposit boxes with probable cause. Then again, if they really wanted to get access to your Google Apps Gmail account they could just poke Google, who would hand them the info they needed on a silver platter thanks to the 1986 Stored Communications Act. <em>IANAL</em></p>
<p><sup>3</sup> 30-day browser cookie set by users that click the &#8220;Remember verification for this computer&#8221; checkbox means that if your computer is stolen, the thief can still access your account without having to provide the second step of verification, and likely not even the password if your computer was just sleeping and browser already open. However, this is a small risk on the grand scheme of things for the security paranoid that have their computer prompt for a password on wake, run services like <a href="http://preyproject.com/" title="Prey Project">Prey (Stammy Approved™)</a>, and even have disk encryption.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Have you tried 1Password&#8217;s strong password generator? It makes passwords like efihGiT{NZiAU+dCz4^yx4Y8d}ZG8C}eG=fGmBx^6pDnhbaRHm</p>

<p><span id="more-7474"></span></p>
<p>When Amazon released Kindle for iPhone, I immediately installed it and to even my own surprise, got suckered into buying several books that night. Unfortunately, I was still set in my old ways and purchased technical reference books. Books like &#8220;Ruby Best Practices&#8221; are not quite conducive to reading on a device that introduces constraints on the taken-for-granted ability to easily flip through pages and line-wraps the crap out of code excerpts. My first Kindle for iPhone experience was a bit shaky. I didn&#8217;t come back for a few months. </p>
<p>The next time I touched it I purchased a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385524382?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0385524382&#038;tag=paulstamatiou-20" title="Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior by Ori and Rom Brafman">Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior</a> while taking the Caltrain to Notifo HQ in Menlo Park. By the end of the week I had read the entire book all on my phone.  Then I read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446563048?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=paulstamatiou-20" title="Delivering Happiness">Zappos book</a> over the next two weeks. I went from zero regular reading to 500 pages read in a month. I chalk it up to the pure convenience and ubiquity of my phone. <strong>I can dive in for a chapter whenever and wherever</strong>. </p>
<p>However, after reading that much on my iPhone it was clear this was not scalable for continued reading purposes. <strong>Holding the phone for hours at a time gets very uncomfortable</strong> not to mention the eye strain from looking at that backlit and small screen so long. That week Jeff Bezos announced the new Kindle. Thinner and lighter than the last version, a higher contrast screen, more internal memory (4GB)&#8230; okay all nice to have but nothing really standing out at me just yet. The price tag was announced at <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Amazon_Kindle3_WiFi" title="Amazon Kindle Wireless Reading Device - Wi-fi Version">$139 USD for a Wi-Fi only version</a>. BINGO! That&#8217;s impulse buy territory for me.</strong> I pre-ordered the Kindle 3 for only $139 paired with my all too useful Amazon Prime account<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>3</sup></a> and it arrived earlier this month.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This review is written from the perspective of someone that has never used any eReader device<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>5</sup></a> or tinkered with E Ink devices. I won&#8217;t be nitpicking about subtle differences between the Kindle 2 and Kindle 3. What you&#8217;re about to read is a newcomer&#8217;s stance on the Kindle 3.</p>
<h4>Don&#8217;t compare it to the iPad. Just don&#8217;t.</h4>
<p>The Kindle 3 is not in the same class as the iPad, so don&#8217;t compare them. The Kindle has a different form factor, is in a massively different (lower) price range, uses different technology (<a href="http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=2750" title="Kindle 3: Under the microscope!">E Ink</a>) and does one thing (reading) really well. That&#8217;s all I want the Kindle to do. Spoiler alert: the Kindle does that single function amazingly well.</p>
<h4>Unboxing &#038; Setup</h4>
<p>As you can expect from the pioneers of Frustation-Free Packaging, the Amazon Kindle is easy to unpack. I just had to pull a strip like I was opening a FedEx&#8217;d document and it opened right up. Here&#8217;s my quick and candid unboxing video:</p>
<div class="center"><object width="620" height="375"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/iiSMd9-ZrcE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/iiSMd9-ZrcE?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="620" height="375"></embed></object></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_unboxed_1200.jpg" title="Kindle 3 Unboxed"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_unboxed.jpg" alt="Kindle 3 Unboxed"/></a><br/><small>Props to Amazon for including a USB cable that is actually long enough to be useful. Though you won&#8217;t use it much with the one month battery life.</small></div>
<p>The Kindle is remarkably thin (1/3rd of an inch) and lightweight (8.5oz). At first I thought the 6-inch screen had some overlay plastic on it as it was displaying an astoundingly crisp and sharp black setup image on it when I opened the box. Nope. That&#8217;s just the E Ink Pearl display in action. Though I should say <em>not</em> in action. E Ink displays only use power/work when changing display items and turning pages<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>There are <strong>slight disadvantages to E Ink</strong>. For example, page turning is not instant and takes a second. <a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>7</sup></a>. Also, every once-in-a-while I will see ghosting. That is to say that some faint elements from the previous page or menu that just closed are present. Fortunately this is not anything like burn-in and goes away completely after a page turn/refresh.</p>
<p>As for the upsides of the E Ink display. It&#8217;s not backlit. Yes, that&#8217;s actually an upside! Less eye strain after hours of reading and it is readable in just about any lighting condition you might encounter indoors or out<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>8</sup></a>. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_timbuk2_1200.jpg" title="Kindle 3 and Timbuk2 bag and sleeve"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_timbuk2.jpg" alt="Kindle 3 and Timbuk2 bag and sleeve"/></a><br/><small>When turned off, the Kindle displays a random image or famous author. Toss the Kindle in your bag and take it everywhere &mdash; you won&#8217;t feel the extra weight. Fantastic battery life means you can fly around for weeks at a time and don&#8217;t have to carry a charger around.</small></div>
<p>Battery life is greatly helped by the use of an E Ink display. A <strong>complete charge lasts an entire month</strong> (3 weeks with Wi-Fi enabled). In addition to the low power E Ink display, the 1750 mAh 3.7v Li-Ion battery and Atheros AR6102G 802.11bg Wi-Fi chip helps the Kindle with its long battery life.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_keyboard_1200.jpg" title="Amazon Kindle 3 Keyboard Closeup"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_keyboard.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle 3 Keyboard Closeup"/></a><br/><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_thin_1400.jpg" title="Kindle 3 Form factor - thin"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_thin.jpg" alt="Kindle 3 Form factor - thin"/></a></div>
<p>The setup process shows Amazon&#8217;s pure genius. The <strong>Kindle is automatically linked to the Amazon account you used to purchase it</strong>. There is no setup process other than connecting to Wi-Fi. Amazon wants to get you buying books and other publications from the Kindle Store as soon as possible and they&#8217;ve done that extremely well. An instruction manual and letter from Jeff Bezos addressed to the name of the owner is pre-loaded onto the device and there is no bulky manual included in the box. The experience so far is flawless.</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_full_holding_1200.jpg" title="Kindle 3 Home Screen"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_full_holding.jpg" alt="Kindle 3 Home Screen"/></a><br/><small>Home screen</small></div>
<p>The learning curve is trivial. The interface consists of a home screen listing your books, magazine subscriptions and other content that is navigated through with a simple 5-way d-pad. Tap the center button of the pad to load a document and flip through pages with the two page back/forward buttons on the left and right sides of the Kindle. Using the 5-way pad within a document moves a cursor around. Put it before a word and the dictionary pops up a definition preview. Start typing and a search box appears. Or tap the 5-way pad and a textarea pops up for you to compose a note. Or click the pad and move the cursor to start highlighting. Any highlights or notes you create will be saved in a &#8220;My Clippings&#8221; item automatically created and listed on the home screen.</p>
<p>Power readers will appreciate the ability to make collections and organize their books. There are self-explanatory Home, Back and Menu buttons. A familiar-looking <strong>Aa</strong> button brings up the readability settings.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_screen_opts.jpg" alt="Kindle Screen Options" title="Kindle Screen Options"/><br/><small></small></div>
<p>These settings also control the <strong>Text-to-Speech settings</strong>. The Kindle&#8217;s speakers are sufficiently loud for this task and there is also a headphone jack on the bottom. The speakers are back-firing so putting the Kindle down on a flat surface helps reflect the sound and appear louder. Aside from changing the voice gender and speaking rate, there are no settings. Amazon lists text-to-speech as an experimental feature. The settings also show a Voice Guide feature that makes navigation easier for the vision impaired with spoken menus and pages. </p>
<p>Hidden in the menu under experimental you&#8217;ll find two interesting items: Web Browser &amp; Play MP3. The latter is fairly uninteresting but it&#8217;s the <strong>WebKit-based browser</strong> that got my attention. Aside from the constraints placed on it from the slow refresh rate of E Ink, the browser actually works well! I found myself browsing Hacker News on it, clicking a link to open an article then tapping Menu and selecting <strong>Article Mode</strong> to transform the article into a Readability-like view.</p>
<div class="center"><object width="620" height="375"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/dUDiKOyeSZA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/dUDiKOyeSZA?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="620" height="375"></embed></object><br/><small>I apologize for the bad lighting, unsteady shots, grainy quality and lack of talking.. I need to spend more than 5 minutes next time!</small></div>
<h4>Instapaper</h4>
<p>After quickly becoming fascinated by this method of putting my daily online reading onto the Kindle, I started looking for other ways to do this. This quickly lead me to <strong>Instapaper&#8217;s Kindle integration</strong>. I had already been an <a href="http://instapaper.com" title="Instapaper">Instapaper</a> user for quite some time and even purchased the iPhone app. It never really became part of my workflow. Instapaper with the Kindle changed that.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_instapaper_1200.jpg" title="Instapaper on the Kindle"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_instapaper.jpg" alt="Instapaper on the Kindle"/></a></div>
<p>I pretty much send every article longer than a 10 minute read to Instapaper and then read it on my Kindle. I usually log into Instapaper and force it to send it to the Kindle when I want to read it instead of waiting until it automatically sends it the next day. This setup has changed the way I read for the better. I have also experimented with <a href="http://kindlefeeder.com/" title="Kindlefeeder">Kindlefeeder</a> for sending RSS feeds to my Kindle.</p>

<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle_store_1200.jpg" title="Amazon Kindle Store"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle_store.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle Store"/></a><br/><small>The Kindle Store</small></div>
<p>Hardware-specs aside, the biggest advantage of the Kindle over any other eReader device is <strong>the massive Kindle Store book catalog</strong> and it&#8217;s tight integration. Browse through 700,000+ titles<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>9</sup></a> from the Kindle, purchase and start reading after it transfers in under a minute. If you&#8217;re not only interested in books, magazines or blogs from the Kindle Store you can manually transfer over any of your personal documents or ebooks in the following formats:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, RTF, Audible (Audible Enhanced (AA, AAX)), MP3, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively; HTML, Microsoft Word, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversion.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can either manually <strong>transfer them over via USB</strong> (it appears as a disk drive) or <strong>email them to your Kindle</strong>. Each Kindle has its own unique and private @kindle.com email address. Send an email<a href="#footnotes" rel="nofollow"><sup>10</sup></a> with an attachment and the Kindle will load it up! There may be some charges involved for email delivery over 3G on models equipped with it, but it&#8217;s free over Wi-Fi. Amazon also has the ability to (attempt to) convert certain documents to the native Kindle format:</p>
<blockquote><p>To have your PDF documents converted to Kindle format so you can take advantage of functionality such as variable font size, annotation, Text-to-Speech, etc., type &#8220;Convert&#8221; in the subject of the e-mail when you submit your personal document to &#8220;name&#8221;@free.kindle.com. Image-heavy PDF files are presented in landscape orientation and don&#8217;t work with devices that have auto-rotation, so those will be delivered in the Kindle format.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve had mixed results with this conversion process and received some converted PDFs with odd characters, missing chunks and so on. The higher quality and less complex the source PDF, the better. Conversion doesn&#8217;t make sense for certain types of PDFs that were created with particular type of style and formatting in mind, so I don&#8217;t have them converted. In short &mdash; conversion makes books &#8220;flowable&#8221; and have pages dynamically change depending on the user&#8217;s text size. </p>
<p><strong>Reading PDFs is a bit clunky on the Kindle</strong>. First off, the 6-inch screen isn&#8217;t large enough for most full-size PDFs I transferred, leaving me with a few dismal options: 1) read it in tiny text, 2) manually zoom in and constantly move the zoomed view over, making the next page buttons useless, 3) read in landscape view with still-tiny text but no annoying zoom to move around.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_pdf_viewing_1600.jpg" title="PDF reading and controls on the Amazon Kindle"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle3_pdf_viewing.jpg" alt="PDF reading and controls on the Amazon Kindle"/></a><br/><small>PDF reading (an unconverted PDF) and controls on the Kindle</small></div>
<p>But there&#8217;s good news! I almost never read PDFs and can always find what I want either in the Kindle Store or in other ebook formats.</p>
<h4>DRM</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, the <strong>Kindle does not support the free and open e-book standard ePub</strong>. Users will have to manually convert the file with <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/" title="calibre e-book management">Calibre</a> to something the Kindle can work with. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle_calibre_1000.png" title="Calibre converting eBook format"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle_calibre.jpg" alt="Calibre converting eBook format"/></a><br/><small>Converting an unprotected ePub file with Calibre</small></div>
<p>That&#8217;s a fairly trivial process unless your ePub has restrictive DRM. This is the case I ran into. My friend Zach suggested I take a look at a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Enter-the-Dragon/dp/B003TO5AJK/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;m=A3TVV12T0I6NSM&#038;qid=1285494500&#038;sr=1-1&#038;tag=paulstamatiou-20" title="Enter the Dragon by Theo Paphitis">&#8220;Enter the Dragon&#8221; by Theo Paphitis</a>. The first thing I did was go to Amazon where I found it in Kindle edition. Great! I&#8217;ll just checkout with one-click buy and it&#8217;ll be on my Kindle soon. </p>
<blockquote><p>Paul, the Kindle Store on Amazon.co.uk is for UK customers only. To shop for titles available for your country, please visit Amazon.com.</p></blockquote>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle_drm.jpg" alt="Kindle Book not available in US Store"/><br/><small>Every once-in-a-while you might see something like this. A region specific book. Reminds me of DVD region codes&#8230; yuck.</small></div>
<p>Damn. Well maybe I can find it in an ebook format elsewhere online. Sure enough I did and purchased it as an ePub for £6. Alright, annoying process but I found the book. All I had to do was convert it to Mobi or AZW and I would be on my merry way. I quickly realized this ePub was laced with <strong>Adobe Digital Editions DRM called ADEPT</strong>. It wasn&#8217;t more than 5 minutes later that I found <a href="http://i-u2665-cabbages.blogspot.com/2009/02/circumventing-adobe-adept-drm-for-epub.html" title="Circumventing Adobe ADEPT DRM for EPUB">two python scripts</a> using PyCrypto to remove the DRM. Phew, all good now but I hope I don&#8217;t have to do that often.</p>
<p><strong>Books purchased through the Kindle Store also have DRM</strong>. It can control whether you can save and share highlights/notes, whether you can enable text-to-speech and perhaps more I haven&#8217;t run into yet. But that&#8217;s pretty minimal on the grand scheme of things. I still love the Kindle.</p>
<h4>Kindle Active Content</h4>
<p>Available only for the U.S. Kindle Store at the moment, Kindle active content is essentially what boils down to <strong>apps for the Kindle</strong>. As of this writing there are only three available and they are all games: Scrabble ($5), Shuffled Row (free) and Every Word (free). It will be interesting to see Amazon try to bring apps over to the Kindle but I can&#8217;t help but think that the hardware limitations, not to mention the 100KB download allowance over 3G, will considerably limit what kinds of active content are brought to market.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle_game_1200.jpg" title="Every Word Game - Kindle Active Content"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pstam_kindle_game.jpg" alt="Every Word Game - Kindle Active Content" title="Every Word Game - Kindle Active Content"/></a><br/><small>&#8220;Every Word&#8221; Kindle Active Content game</small></div>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<p>No doubt about it, the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Amazon_Kindle3_WiFi" title="Amazon Kindle Wireless Reading Device">Kindle 3</a> receives the very first <strong>11 out of 10 Stammys rating</strong> on this blog. I absolutely love this thing more than any gadget in recent past. Just don&#8217;t compare it to an iPad.</p>
<p>You might be thinking why I gave it such an outstanding rating despite the DRM speed bumps. There were two DRM issues at hand. The first was not being able to purchase a particular Kindle book in the U.S. store (likely enforced by the publisher and out of Amazon&#8217;s hands) and resorting to buying a protected ePub file elsewhere. The latter was Kindle store DRM imposing controls on books such as not being able to use text-to-speech or save notes. Neither of those are really big issues for me.</p>
<p><strong>The price is right, the hardware is great and the book catalog is best in class. The rest is nitpicking.</strong></p>
<h4>Buy the Kindle 3</h4>
<p>I don&#8217;t do this very often, but I can&#8217;t help but recommend the Kindle and hopefully it will change your daily workflow in some way like it did mine. Here are links to purchase the Kindle through my affiliate code on Amazon. I only get a tiny percentage of the price but it helps pay the rent while I&#8217;m doing the startup thing.</p>

<a name="footnotes"></a><br />
<sup>1</sup> All of which are now collecting dust in my closet at home in Texas ever since my move to SF. I sent them all home, though I should probably donate or sell them off when I next visit home. Sometime in 2008 I realized I almost always search online for technical topics and always find what I&#8217;m looking for &ndash; so much so that I never actually referenced my technical reference books. For one they just got outdated so quickly. I usually search on Google and filter the results by the last 3-6 months so I&#8217;m sure to find fresh content.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Not quite sure how, but my name and address found its way on some sort of book press list. I am often sent new books relating to technology and entrepreneurship. Two of these books were Daniel Suarez&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525951113?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0525951113&#038;tag=paulstamatiou-20" title="Daemon by Daniel Suarez">Daemon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MAJNUS?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=B003MAJNUS&#038;tag=paulstamatiou-20" title="Freedom by Daniel Suarez">Freedom (TM)</a>. Not finished reading them yet but definitely two great techno-thriller books. That reminds me to get around to reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553380958?ie=UTF8&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0553380958&#038;tag=paulstamatiou-20" title="Snow Crash">Snow Crash</a>.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> Quite easily the best and worst thing I have purchased. Actually it was free through an Amazon student deal. Amazon Prime makes it all to easy to say &#8220;eh why not!&#8221; when nearing checkout. This leads to many impulse purchases for various things ranging from vitamins to socks that I could just pick up down the street.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Hacker Monthly is a great, great compilation of popular articles from Hacker News. It used to be free but is now paid. Still entirely worth it in my opinion. Keep an eye out for the October issue. I put an ad in there for Notifo.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> Aside from the 5 minutes I played with a Barnes &#038; Noble Nook and absolutely hated it. Slow UI, heavier and clunkier device, slower page turns, smaller book catalog, more expensive, et cetera.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper" title="Electronic Paper">Electronic paper</a> on Wikipedia</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> The Kindle&#8217;s display refresh rate is actually best in class. The first thing I noticed when I played with a Nook is that its display had a slower refresh rate.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Aside from the obvious no lights issue. But like a regular book you can clip on a reading light. Just don&#8217;t get the kind that uses the Kindle&#8217;s own meager power source. Find a AAA-powered LED one.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> U.S. Kindle Store</p>
<p><sup>10</sup> Must be sent from an approved email address. This is done on Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;Manage Your Kindle&#8221; page after you login.</p>

My posting frequency on this blog has gone down a bunch and my online presence has been silent except for some sporadic <a href="http://twitter.com/stammy" title="@Stammy - Paul Stamatiou Twitter">tweets</a>. I have been keeping busy hacking away on Notifo for about 3 months now and we&#8217;re making some great progress that I&#8217;d like to share with everyone. As I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/notifo-yc-w2010-gets-a-co-founder-me" title="Notifo (YCombinator W2010) Gets a Co-Founder... Me">mentioned in my first post about Notifo</a>, I joined as Co-Founder alongside <a href="http://twitter.com/jazzychad" rel="nofollow" title="Chad Etzel on Twitter">Chad</a> and we have been working out of a garage in Menlo Park. We then began splitting up the commute and started working out of my apartment in San Francisco every other week. But one of us would still incur a hefty 3 hour roundtrip commute in addition to the usual ~12 hour work day. Fortunately, this commute will go away when Chad moves to San Francisco in mid-September and our productivity will skyrocket, but I digress. <span id="more-7429"></span></p>
<p>Like my <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/full-time-startup-skribit-week-30-coding-coding-coding" title="Full-time Startup: Skribit Week 30 (Coding, coding, coding">&#8220;Full-time Startup: Skribit Week X&#8221; posts</a>, I hope to share my startup journey with Notifo in similar manner. </p>
<h4>Tell me one more time. What is Notifo?</h4>
<p>Like all platforms, Notifo can prove difficult to explain without providing prospective users a set of use cases that are directly relevant to their daily lives. As new services and projects are built on top of Notifo, this <strong>job becomes much easier</strong>. For example, my friend Dimitry didn&#8217;t quite understand Notifo until he saw Philip Kelly <a href="http://chatch.es/blog/2010/07/22/ikea-product-availability-notifier/" title="IKEA Product Availability Notifier">release his IKEA Product availability notifier</a>.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/dimitry_notifo.png" alt="What is Notifo - Dimitry"/></div>
<p>Notifo enables anyone to send <strong>impossibly quick push notifications to their mobile devices</strong> and those of their users/subscribers. Notifications usually arrive in under 3 seconds. Notifo strives to build and manage the things below so users and services don&#8217;t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile and desktop applications that receive Notifo notifications for a variety of devices</li>
<li>Notifo push backend, API, and web app where everything for users and services can be managed, services can view analytics and so on</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The real draw of Notifo for services</strong>? Not having to make their own mobile/client applications for every mobile device their users use. Today we have an iPhone app, and you can bet we&#8217;ll be expanding to other mobile devices quickly.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/service_dashboard.png" alt="Notifo Service Dashboard"/><br/><small>The current Notifo Service Dashboard. Future implementations will provide services with in-depth analytics and [off the record awesome feature]</small></div>
<p> Hacker News user <a href="http://notifo.com/buzz" title="What They're Saying - Notifo Buzz">Patrick McKenzie (patio11) says it best</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A permission marketing channel in the pocket of your users? Yes, please.<br />
[Notifo] solves a real, pressing need for many sites: maintaining user engagement after they&#8217;re off your website. That is pure profit for the company, since you&#8217;ve already spent whatever form of resources it took to acquire them as a signup in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone can create a Notifo Service with our API and any user can subscribe to a service. Users can fine-tune how they receive these notifications (more in the next section). There is also the concept of a &#8220;project&#8221;; like a self-hosted service but using the user&#8217;s own API key instead and can only send the user notifications. Notifications sent through the user&#8217;s personal API key are entirely free. <a href="http://notifo.com" title="Notifo Services and Projects">More Services and projects listed here &raquo;</a></p>
<p>We will be releasing a complete pricing model soon but in short: everything for users will always be free (though services could be made that charge for certain things, like real-time sports scores), while services will pay monthly based on the number of notifications they send, with a few add-on features not yet announced that will incur additional fees.</p>

<h4>Today&#8217;s Announcements!</h4>
<p>Last week we launched a complete website overhaul along with a new support forum. This is the first step into growing a community around Notifo. The <a href="http://notifo.com/services" title="Notifo Services">services page</a> currently lists some of the services and projects on Notifo, but will be replaced down the line with a more robust gallery giving people a public place where they can promote and manage their services and projects. The first versions of a new user setup guide and developer guide were released then as well. More developer-centric guides and documentation will be added in the near future. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://notifo.com" title="Notifo - Mobile Notifications for Everything"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/notifo_redesign.png" alt="Notifo - Mobile Notifications for Everything"/></a></div>
<p>We also launched a <strong><a href="http://notifo.com/desktop" title="Notifo Desktop Apps">desktop app for OS X</a></strong> last week. But that&#8217;s not what this blog post is about. <strong>The next version of our iPhone app that just went live this morning</strong>. Considering that it has not been updated for a few months, this release has much more than just a handful of new features. Here are the more <strong>notable changes and features</strong>:</p>
<ul style="font-size:1.1em;">
<li><strong>User Text Messaging</strong> &mdash; Send free messages to other Notifo users in addition to images.</li>
<li>Set how, when and where you want to receive notifications with <strong>advanced service settings and new notification types</strong>.</li>
<li>Manage your notifications, service subscriptions and more all within the application</li>
<li>20+ sounds to choose from for each notification type.</li>
</ul>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/notifo_convo_964.png" title="User Messaging in Notifo for iPhone"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/notifo_convo_620.png" alt="User Messaging in Notifo for iPhone"/></a><br/><small>New User Messaging Sections of Notifo</small></div>
<p><strong>Why add user messaging?</strong> First and foremost, Notifo is and will always be entirely focused on notifications for services. We are introducing user messaging today as a way to help grow the number of installed Notifo apps while services is still maturing. If you want to use Notifo&#8217;s user message to forego SMS text charges then you&#8217;re likely to tell your friends about it too. Then they will find interesting services to subscribe to.. and so on. It&#8217;s the chicken and egg problem &ndash; services don&#8217;t want to use a platform with no users, users don&#8217;t want to use something that they can&#8217;t do anything with.</p>
<p>The Notifo app is still based around the &#8220;inbox for your push notifications&#8221; concept with a tab for notifications and a new tab for conversations. Tap a notification to expand the message, double tap to open any attached URL (notifications from certain services like Push.ly will switch to the corresponding app already on your phone, like Twitter for iPhone if a tweet is linked), or tap and hold to copy the notification message. </p>
<p>The real treats are for power users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send any website linked to a notification to your Instapaper account</li>
<li>Tap &#8220;Grouped&#8221; when on the Notifications tab to group your notifications by service. Then, tap any service to see them grouped by service event.</li>
<li>Have lots of active conversations? Tap &#8220;Edit&#8221; then &#8220;Mark All Read&#8221;. </li>
<li>Scroll to the top of any conversation and tap &#8220;User Options&#8221; to block the user, report as spam, change the notification sound played when you receive their notification, or change the notification type to one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Normal &mdash; sound/vibration active when not in quiet hours</li>
<li>Important &mdash; audible regardless of any quiet hours set</li>
<li>Silent &mdash; notification pops up and screen lights up but no sound/vibration</li>
<li>Stealth &mdash; no audible/visible notification but they will appear in the conversation timeline</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manage service subscriptions entirely within the iPhone app</li>
<li>Services have <strong>several new notification types</strong>, in addition to the ones listed earlier for users:
<ul>
<li><strong>Momentary</strong> &mdash; will be delivered to your mobile device with sound/vibration in addition to any desktop clients you have setup but will not be stored in your account or shown in your notifications timeline. (Ideal for high-volume services)</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Only</strong> &mdash; only delivered to any linked desktop clients, not mobile devices (Ideal for high-volume services)</li>
<li><strong>Ignore</strong> &mdash; Will not be received or displayed anywhere. Ideal for not showing particular service events that you may not care about while not blocking the entire service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>User Messaging details will soon be added to our API&#8230; <strong>which opens the doors for bots</strong>! Anyone will be able to <strong>build a bot that can respond to a set of commands to fetch some data for you or pretty much do anything for you, all in real-time</strong>. We have a few proof-of-concept bots currently in place: notifo, Facebook, Twitter and Posterous bots. Just message any of them (the latter three need to be setup in the &#8220;Connect With&#8230;&#8221; Settings).</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s <strong>a lot to absorb here so it&#8217;s probably just <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notifo/id359063459?mt=8" title="Notifo for iPhone">best to install the free Notifo iPhone app for yourself</a></strong> and tinker around. My favorite part of this release is all the notification types paired with individual service events. This enables you to have many different sounds and notification delivery options for the different types of services to which you subscribe.</p>
<p>Search for &#8220;Notifo&#8221; in the App Store and install it, then signup for an account and setup services on <a href="http://notifo.com" title="Notifo Mobile Notifications for Everything">Notifo.com</a>. Let us know what you think! </p>

<h4>Push.ly, Meet Site Streams</h4>
<p>Last but not least, our flagship Notifo service, <a href="http://push.ly" title="Push.ly - Twitter mentions pushed to your phone">Push.ly</a>, has been polished up with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/30/twitter-site-streams-beta/" title="Twitter Site Streams Beta">Twitter&#8217;s latest super-fast API dubbed Site Streams</a>. Push.ly is among the first to launch with the new beta of Site Streams. This means that users can have not only Twitter @-replies pushed to their phone (including from private accounts, new with Site Streams) but also DMs (which previously would have required some funky and slow email forwarding to work), new follower notifications and favorites.</p>
<p>Push.ly is a great service to put the new iPhone app&#8217;s notification and event settings to use. More info in our <strong><a href="http://blog.notifo.com/pushly-partners-with-twitter-site-streams" title="Pushly partners with Twitter Site Streams">official announcement</a></strong>!</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/notifo_app_pushly_964.png" title="Notifo iPhone app with Push.ly Service"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/notifo_app_pushly.png" alt="Notifo iPhone app with Push.ly Service"/></a><br/><small>Left to Right: 1) Push.ly Service Settings, 2) Event Listing, 3) Settings page for a particular Event with various sounds that can be used.</small></div>
<p>As a sidenote, we also updated our <strong><a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lgffhepmapgeepjnhchaabmaoijfcnhi" title="Chrome to Notifo extension">Google Chrome browser extension</a></strong> that lets you easily send webpages, photos, selected text and more to your Notifo-enabled devices. Handy for consuming content on the go. It uses some new-fangled Chrome APIs and as such only works with Chrome 6.0+ (Dev version as of this moment). </p>
<h4>What&#8217;s Next?</h4>
<p>During the development of this iPhone app update and website overhaul we implemented several internal features that we have been using. Our next step is to clean them up and introduce them into our public API for others to enjoy. This includes user messaging and bot documentation, small tweaks like being able to see if a subscription request is pending, and a few larger features that aren&#8217;t quite ready for the limelight.</p>

I have been using some form of that script since then to backup my blog. Fortunately, I have never had a situation where I needed to completely restore my blog, though it was handy for the few times I accidentally nuked my root .htaccess file or something. Ideally, I would keep everything under git version control and possibly have a nice <a href="http://github.com/jestro/wordpress-capistrano">WordPress Capistrano</a> setup on my server for keeping WordPress and related non-media files safe and easily accessible (versus having to download then decompress a huge archive just to get to one file). In addition, I would have an rsync to S3 backup for media files and the database. But like many of you, I don&#8217;t have the time to figure that out right now. That&#8217;s why I became intrigued when I first caught wind of <strong>Automattic&#8217;s turnkey WordPress backup service called <a href="http://vaultpress.com" title="Automattic VaultPress">VaultPress</a></strong>. Pay a monthly fee, set it and forget it.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/pstam_s3_backup.png" alt="Amazon S3 Blog Backups"/><br/><small>My backup situation looked like this (and a terminal) before VaultPress.</small></div>

<p>VaultPress is a complete WordPress blog backup solution. Everything related to your WordPress installation from theme files and uploaded media all the way to the database will be backed up. Want to know the best part about it? <strong>Real-time backup</strong>. The second anything changes on your WordPress setup, be it a new post revision is saved, a new comment is created, a tag is added to a post, a new user registers, a plugin is added, an image uploaded&#8230; <em>anything</em>, VaultPress gets pinged and that particular change is updated in your backup. </p>
<blockquote><p>The VaultPress plugin uses WordPress hooks to receive alerts when any information has changed on your site and syncs those changes with our servers. Live ticker messages are displayed to show the status of exactly what’s going on – backing up a comment, adding a new post, changing an option, etc</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some edge cases where VaultPress won&#8217;t know if you changed something, such as manual file uploading/editing via FTP, so it does an entire site scan every evening to detect any such changes and sync the backup as necessary. Depending on the plan you are signed up for, VaultPress will be able to scan for potential security threats as well.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I need to explain the benefits of real-time backup. Having backups initiate the moment something changes is much better than having to wait hours for my old cron job script to kick in. </p>
<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>First things first: VaultPress is currently in a private beta and many of its features have not yet been baked in. The information in this review will very likely be outdated in a few months, so please keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Setting up VaultPress is as simple as installing their plugin. It&#8217;s not just any plugin, but rather a custom plugin just for your domain and blog. You need to have a WordPress.com account to be able to log into VaultPress to get the plugin but it will work on any self-hosted WordPress blog. After the plugin is uploaded and activated it will begin the lengthy first backup. I did not experience any issues with my first backup. It took a few hours to backup 5 years of blog posts, images, et cetera. I was able to monitor the progress within the WordPress admin panel as well as see general backup information.</p>

<h4>Backup</h4>
<p>After the plugin is setup there&#8217;s nothing else to it. VaultPress will continuously backup your blog as necessary. Logging into the VaultPress Dashboard provides more backup details and is where you&#8217;ll go when it comes time to initiate a restore or download backed up files:</p>
<blockquote><p>This page provides a complete snapshot of each backup. Along with the date and time of each and every backup, you can review how many users, comments, attachments, pages, posts, revisions, safecss, authors, categories, link categories, post tags, uploads, images, themes, and plugins (whew!) are included in each of the backups.</p>
<p>You can also retrieve your data here by checking the box next to plugins, uploads, database, themes or all of the above and hitting that “download” button.</p></blockquote>

<h4><del datetime="2010-08-30T06:12:10+00:00">Restoring</del> Downloading then Manually Uploading</h4>
<p>What happens when something happens to your site and you need to fix something or revert to the most recent backup? Unfortunately, there is no automated restore feature built into VaultPress <em>yet</em>. At the moment you will have to download the backup archive to your local machine, decompress it, then use an FTP client to manually upload it to your server. Obviously a painful and very slow, manual ordeal.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/pstam_vaultpress_download.png" alt="VaultPress Backup Download"/><br/><small>VaultPress archives my uploads and then offers me a .tar.gz download.</small></div>
<p>Yeah, definitely not ideal. I went poking around the <a href="http://blog.vaultpress.com/2010/07/30/we-like-big-downloads/" title="We Like Big Downloads - VaultPress Blog">VaultPress blog</a> for upcoming plans:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have two things on the roadmap to address this. The first, and most important, is server-to-server restores. That means instead of you being in the middle, you give us a SFTP login and destination for your account and our high-speed servers talk directly to your high-speed servers and do in minutes what would take you hours or days. This is a high priority for us.</p>
<p>The second, to get around the archival problem, is allowing people to subscribe to get their backups on physical media, like a Blu-ray disk shipped to their office, or a USB stick.</p></blockquote>
<p>A server-to-server restore that appears to be in the works would be ideal and I can image the Automattic folks will do a great job implementing this. Until then, I downloaded a complete blog backup from WordPress, complete with some 194,000 items. It <strong>took VaultPress 31 minutes to build the archive</strong>, then 2 minutes for me to download the 453MB archive and a minute to decompress it to 550MB. Inside the archive there were 5 folders: <strong>plugins, root, sql, themes, uploads</strong>. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/vaultpress_backup_files.png" alt="VaultPress backup files"/><br/><small>Files &#038; Folders in a complete VaultPress backup</small></div>
<p>The plugins, themes and uploads folders were a  straight copy of their respective equivalents within wp-content. However, the backup lacked any .svn metadata folders that were in those folders on my blog server. The root folder contained 3 files: my favicon.ico, robots.txt and wp-config.php. I was disappointed to see <strong>it did not include my heavily modified .htaccess</strong> file. And finally, the sql folder contained individual *.sql files for each table in my WordPress database. I like how they were separated by table instead of one file. That makes it easier to selectively restore parts of the database. For example if only your options got hosed you can just import wp_options.sql into phpMyAdmin.</p>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/pstam_vaultpress_pricing.png" alt="VaultPress Pricing"/><br/><small>Official VaultPress pricing is still in the works.</small></div>
<p>Okay so what do we have thus far? An automated backup solution for your blog. Assuming that VaultPress will soon provide an easy backup restore solution, I still have a few nitpicks. Most important: I would like the ability to tell VaultPress to b<strong>ackup other files and folders on my server that are not part of WordPress</strong>. For example, I have various folders in the root of my site that while not directly related to WordPress, are still relied upon by my blog and would need to be backed up as well. Perhaps this issue is a known shortcoming of VaultPress&#8217;s offering &mdash; that it is a <em>blog</em> backup solution, not an entire server backup solution?</p>
<p>VaultPress can&#8217;t do real-time continuous backups for things that don&#8217;t run through the plugin and set off one of its event handlers to initiate a backup/sync. At the very least VaultPress needs to backup the root .htaccess file and perhaps ask me what other files to backup on a regular basis. I hate when I do an automated WordPress update and it replaces my .htaccess file with a vanilla WordPress .htaccess.</p>
<p>That being said, <strong>VaultPress alone will not provide enough coverage</strong> for most advanced bloggers; bloggers that run self-hosted third party analytics suites, image galleries, host their own files for things like TinyGrab and more.</p>
<p>As for pricing, that is still up in the air but I have seen numbers between $15-40 per month online. Beta customers such as myself are currently on a discounted $15/month plan for the basic tier of service. A premium plan is also being offered and provides security scans as well. Personally, real-time database backup alone is worth at least $30 per month for me (I already pay $40/month for Amazon S3 for my various online backups and <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-getting-started-with-amazon-cloudfront" title="How To: Getting Started with Amazon CloudFront">CloudFront</a> usage). If VaultPress saves me only one lost/corrupted/PEBKAC/what-have-you blog post per year, it <strong>will still pay for itself</strong>. However it is rather unsettling that I will need to have multiple paid backup solutions in place to ensure I have all of my server data backed up. At this rate, I do not think I will be retiring my S3 backup script anytime soon.</p>
<p>At the moment VaultPress is clearly in the early stages of product development and it would not be fair to rate their current offering. A backup service without an automated restoration feature is rather half-baked. When this automated restoration feature goes live, however, I would not hesitate to <strong>rate VaultPress 8.5 out of 10 Stammys</strong>.</p>
<p>VaultPress provides a sleek backup solution centered around the ease of setup you&#8217;ve come to expect with everything created by the Automattic/WordPress folks. You&#8217;ll just have to decide if its shortcomings are worth it to you based on how much you blog and what it means to you.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts? What is your current server backup plan like? Would you consider using VaultPress? If so, how much would you pay?</strong> </p>

It should be no surprise that I am always on my computer &ndash; at least 12-15 hours per day. I am 5&#8242; 9&#8243; but used to weigh an undesirable 170-175 pounds.  Most of this was brought on during my first years of college. I entered college as a skinny freshman with tons of energy that I soon channeled to my keyboard. Around January 2009, just after I had graduated from Georgia Tech, I began working full-time on <a href="http://skribit.com" title="Skribit - Cure Writer's Block">Skribit</a> from my apartment in Atlanta. My lifestyle had become one of pure startup routine. I was loving it; building what I wanted from home all day sounded like a dream come true.  I used to run into &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been outside in three days&#8221; situations regularly. <span id="more-7357"></span></p>
<p>Before I proceed, I want to say that I have been meaning to write something like this post for a long time and many others on Twitter have been requesting the same of me. I finally got the motivation to write this post after reading Zed Shaw&#8217;s great article, <a href="http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1281257293.html" title="Common Programmer Health Problems">Common Programmer Health Problems</a>, on Hacker News. It was the following excerpt that got me thinking about writing a post for programmers and startup folks that are looking for a way to learn some healthy eating habits while doing their necessary 12+ hours per day on the computer thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, I&#8217;ve been the exact same weight, flexibility, and nearly the same strength my whole life, whether I worked out or not, which means that I probably can&#8217;t tell you about how to lose weight. I&#8217;m most likely genetically predisposed to be this way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now you know where I&#8217;m coming from. I am not a doctor. Don&#8217;t listen to anything I say below. I&#8217;m just telling my own little story.</p>
<p>I quickly picked up a coffee habit and relied on frozen food, eating out and take-out too much. I knew things had to change but I was too devoted to staying near my computer to do anything else. Nothing really changed until that summer when I decided to move to a cheaper apartment near a big park, hoping that the proximity would encourage me to go out for jogging more often. Going along with that notion I adopted a hyper black labrador/pitbull puppy to keep me company at home and drag me outside on walks several times per day.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/piedmont_park.jpeg" alt="Piedmont Park in Midtown Atlanta"/><br/><small>Piedmont Park</small></div>
<p>Then I started feeling really shitty. On the third day of having a 100+ deg F fever I went to the hospital for some tests. 3 hours and $3,000 later I found out my immune system was weak and I had caught <a href="https://health.google.com/health/ref/Mononucleosis" title="Mononucleosis">mono</a> somehow. No cure; just 2 months of perpetual fever, sleeping 18 hours a day and not eating much.</p>
<p>After that ordeal, I knew things had to change. I joined a kickball team (that I did for 3 seasons in a row) and started taking longer walks and jogs with my dog. That did not seem to help. <strong>It was time to radically change my lifestyle</strong>.</p>
<p>I have gone through &#8220;phases&#8221; before where I get involved with one particular sport or activity. For a while that was running. Heck, I even had my own Nike commercial:</p>
<div class="center"><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/08KtqhR0bf0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/08KtqhR0bf0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></div>
<p>But I never really saw results. Then in January 2010 I suddenly had the bright idea that maybe if I <strong>exercised <em>and</em> ate healthy</strong> I might see some positive results. Brilliant and utterly original idea right? </p>
<h4>Stammy&#8217;s so-called Startup Diet</h4>
<p>This time I was not going to mess around. I was serious and had all the motivation in the world. I began by going through my kitchen and throwing out everything unhealthy or snack food related. I evaluated my current caloric intake, roughly 2,150 calories per day with a 25.1 BMI, when I started. For the next three months I was strict with everything I ate. I began logging my meals including calories, fat and protein content in Excel.</p>
<p>For the first two weeks I started with 1,700 calorie days. Then I went down to 1,500 for two weeks. Then I was on a strict 1,200 calories per day diet for about two months, with notable exceptions being days I would workout. Purely restricting calories is only part of the equation, it actually depends more so on what you eat and what portion of those calories are fat, protein and carbohydrates. Limiting yourself to 1,200 calories per day is extreme. There are many diets based around this; Google for &#8220;1200 calorie diet&#8221; or something similar. Again, I&#8217;m not saying this is <em>the</em> way to do it. You can do the same thing by eating 1,700 healthy calories and spending a bit more time working out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll begin by listing some of the things I <strong>cut out of my diet</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything with High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)!</strong> &ndash; This includes soda, snack foods, some cereals, some breads, most ketchup, ice cream, some salad dressings and even those Nutri-Grain bars marketed as being healthy. Some of the &#8220;low fat&#8221; foods are actually bad for you because they are high in HFCS or other sugary additives. Keep an eye out for that.</li>
<li><strong>Alcohol</strong> &ndash; This was easy to do once I started looking up caloric values of various liquors and beers. Guinness is nice and all but I&#8217;m not going to devote 170 calories to a pint of it. Combine this with the fact that all low calorie beers taste horrible, my choice to cut down my alcohol intake was pretty easy. I went from having more than a few beers on the weekends to having 1-2 a week, if any.</li>
<li><strong>Juices &#038; Smoothies</strong> &ndash; I know Odwalla and Naked brand drinks look healthy and are a great snack but they are <a href="http://summertomato.com/shocking-sugar-content-of-common-food-products/" title="Shocking Sugar Content of Common Food Products">ridiculously high in sugar</a>. It doesn&#8217;t matter that the sugar is &#8220;organic evaporated cane juice&#8221; from &#8220;sun-ripened sugarcane&#8221; or that the sugars are natural from the fruit. It&#8217;s still sugar that your body needs to process. Look at an orange juice bottle next time you go to the supermarket.</li>
<li><strong>Red Meats in general, and most processed meat</strong> &ndash; Avoid high fat, cholesterol and sodium nitrite. The latter is commonly found in smoked processed meats.</li>
<li><strong>Most Dairy</strong> &ndash; I love cheese and milk as much as the next person but it had to go. Notably this also meant creamer for my coffee (As of this writing I have since cut-out coffee too). One exception to this rule was fat free Greek yogurt.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Carbs like  refined white flour, pastas</strong> &ndash; instead I opted for only whole grains, nothing milled or crushed. Refined flour, white bread and pastas so on provide you with energy quickly but turn into sugar in the blood, causing your blood sugar to spike and your body to store the sugar as fat. The energy runs out just as quickly, you crash and feel like you need to eat again.</li>
</ul>
<p>I began each morning with breakfast. I made an omelette with onions and green peppers or scrambled eggs every morning &mdash; mostly egg whites, with a bit of yolk for flavor &mdash; with a slice or two of flourless sprouted wheat bread (I look for Alvarado Street Bakery that I have found at Publix, Safeway and Trader Joe&#8217;s), a banana and a bit of healthy fat from almonds and walnuts. Other times I would have brown rice instead of the bread, or make <a href="http://zenhabits.posterous.com/my-favorite-healthy-breakfast" title="My Favorite Healthy Breakfast">this oatmeal</a>. However, I tried avoiding all complex carbs like brown rice past noon. Complex carbs provide energy for your entire day as it takes your body longer to digest and thus release the blood sugar at a slower rate, but if you eat them too late and go to sleep, your body will store it as fat. </p>
<p>Lunch and dinner usually involved 4-6 oz of low-sodium, low-fat chicken (Trader Joe&#8217;s has some great precooked, vacuum-sealed chicken breasts if you want to go the precooked route, but they are a tad salty), broccoli, unsalted corn or brown rice and a side salad with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Between meals I would munch on apples, celery, carrots, grapes or a cup of non-fat Greek yogurt with some granola, raspberries and blueberries.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wasabi_chicken_salad.jpg" alt="Balsamic chicken salad with wasabi"/><br/><small>Balsamic marinated chicken with herbs from Trader Joes, salad and wasabi. I soon learned that I put way too much wasabi in that salad. </small></div>
<p>The first two weeks of being strict and counting calories were the hardest. I was always hungry, grumpy and tired. I pushed through and kept myself busy. Shortly after, I felt great despite the much lower caloric intake. </p>
<p>Then one day a week I would splurge and eat whatever I wanted. Yes, you read that correctly. <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/04/06/how-to-lose-20-lbs-of-fat-in-30-days-without-doing-any-exercise/"  title="How to Lose 20 lbs. of Fat in 30 Days… Without Doing Any Exercise">Tim Ferris explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paradoxically, dramatically spiking caloric intake in this way once per week increases fat loss by ensuring that your metabolic rate (thyroid function, etc.) doesn’t downregulate from extended caloric restriction. That’s right: eating pure crap can help you lose fat.</p></blockquote>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/pstam_relax_food.jpg" alt="Waffles and Orange Juice"/><br/><small>Sunday is usually my &#8220;let myself go&#8221; day and it usually starts with whole grain waffles and syrup (HFCS overload!) and orange juice (too much sugar).</small></div>
<p>You might have noticed one thing &mdash; these meals require cooking. The best thing you can do to help you take control of your health is <strong>learn to cook and stop eating out</strong>. I used to eat out a ton. Not only was it unhealthy but it added at least $200 to my monthly expenses. Instead, use that money and buy yourself a non-stick grill pan for cooking meats and an omelette pan. Get a smaller than standard 12-inch of the latter though, that makes it easier to cook single servings for yourself.</p>
<p>I made a point to learn how to cook at least one or two new things a month. I had no idea where to start so I turned to Twitter:</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://twitter.com/Stammy/status/7389918542" title="Paul Stamatiou on Twitter"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/food-blogs.png" alt="Stammy on Twitter asking for food blogs"/></a></div>
<p>That led me to some great food sites:</p>

</ul>
<p>With every meal and throughout the day, I drank water. Just water. Lots and lots of water. There was always a cup of cold water on my desk. I also took a few supplements alongside my regular daily multivitamin: flaxseed oil (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid#Health_benefits">ω−3</a>), Vitamin C, and fiber with psyllium husks for digestive health, along with 5000 IU of Vitamin D3 in an oil-based capsule every other day (<a href="http://heartscanblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/getting-vitamin-d-right.html" title="Getting Vitamin D right">more info about Vitamin D</a>). <strong>Vitamin D3 is quite possibly the most important</strong> of the bunch for programmers that stay indoors all day. Other eating habits I picked up along the way included eating slower and eating only enough to satisfy my hunger. That is to say that I usually <strong>ate half of whatever I ordered when I did eat out at restaurants</strong>. </p>
<p>The only time I wasn&#8217;t drinking water was when I was drinking a whey protein shake along side a protein and complex carb heavy meal after a workout:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/workout_meal.jpg" alt="Whey protein meal"/></div>
<p>Which brings me to the next section &mdash; <strong>exercise</strong>. While I had been doing some minimal 1-2 mile/day walks in the park with my dog, I realized I would have to make a more serious workout commitment to start seeing any real results. It was around mid-January at the time and every gym near me was having some sort of New Year&#8217;s Resolution deal. What would usually cost $350+ for the year would be under $150. Great!</p>
<p>With a gym membership in tow I began going every two to three days. For the first few weeks, I kept it simple with jogging on the treadmill or using an elliptical machine for at least 30 minutes. My motivation for going to the gym was rather stupid but it worked &mdash; I wanted to become the mayor on Foursquare. I never did get the mayorship.. the gym rat badge will have to suffice.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/pstam_gym_elliptical.jpg" alt="Elliptical trainer at the gym"/><br/><small>Some of my best startup ideas came from brainstorming during mind-numbingly boring jogging</small></div>
<p>Then I began doing <strong>30 minutes</strong> of elliptical or jogging and <strong>30 minutes</strong> of a mixture of tricep dips, erg machine, shoulder press and some free weights. Again, I am not a doctor or trainer so I am not liable for what happens when you take my advice. That being said, while I did not have a trainer I would often workout late at night when there was no crowd (usually between 11pm and 1am) when the serious workout guys would go and they would often give me tips on proper form and technique.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>This post may read like a brain dump as that is exactly what it is. Just showing my side of what I did to get a bit healthier. I&#8217;m not saying this is <em>the</em> way for startup folks to get in shape, it&#8217;s just the route I chose while working on my last startup. If you&#8217;re reading this and are interesting in doing something similar, start by just keeping a log of what you eat in a typical day. Use a site like <a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/" title="Self Nutrition Data">NutritionData</a> to look up calorie, fat and protein information if you&#8217;re not sure.</p>
<p><strong>In short:</strong> eat slower, eat healthier with good fats and low <a href="http://www.glycemicindex.com/" title="Glycemic Index">glycemic index</a> carbs, eat proper portions and get outside of the damn house every day. Pro tip: do 15 pushups and 15 crunches as soon as you wake up. It&#8217;ll get your heart rate going and wake you up like a cup of coffee. </p>
<p>As you can tell by the title of this post, my &#8220;startup diet&#8221; and exercise worked well for me. <strong>I lost about 35 pounds: 2-2.5 pounds per week for the first 3 months.</strong> Then I moved to San Francisco and didn&#8217;t really workout for a few months but getting around the city by foot and walking at least 2 miles per day kept me in check. I&#8217;m now at 135 pounds with a BMI of 19.9 and 11.8% body fat. The next step for me is moving to a more protein oriented diet and building muscle, perhaps doing P90X that I have been meaning to try out. I no longer count calories but after doing it everyday for the first few months I have a good idea of the calories of most foods I eat.</p>

<p><span id="more-7246"></span></p>
<p>As I began writing this post, I received an email from <a href="http://twitter.com/denverbob10">Rob Hellman</a> on the subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>Big fan of your blog. I had a question or rather a request for your opinion of the future of tablet/pad devices. As a business traveler, i looked long and hard at the iPad but just couldn&#8217;t justify the price vs lack of key features that I utilize. I know that there are a lot of rumors out there with android tablets, windows, and who knows what else being made in the next 6-9 month timeframe. Do you see any upcoming that have caught your eye? Any thoughts on operating systems? Thanks!</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people I know, myself included, are in the same situation as Rob. Current tablet devices and ultralights are pricey and have proprietary software that doesn&#8217;t quite let you unleash the power of the hardware underneath it all or customize the OS to do quite what you want. While this might seem like an obvious slap at the iPad, I&#8217;m attempting to just present the facts. Sure, the iPad is sexy, sleek and there are some pretty neat iPad apps available but the bundled Apple tax makes it quite limiting otherwise. That and it has a measly 256MB of RAM and can&#8217;t multitask (until iPad-friendly iOS4 is released). Paying $5+ per application to do what you can already do with Linux for free is a bit unnerving. Of course, I&#8217;m typing this on a $3,000 MacBook Pro. C&#8217;est la vie.</p>
<p>Hopefully the rest of this blog post will provide Rob and others in this situation with a potential solution &mdash; <strong>going the netbook route</strong>. </p>
<h4>The Hardware</h4>
<p>The particular netbook I have at the moment is an <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/ASUS_Eee_PC_1005HA" title="ASUS Eee PC 1005HA Netbook">ASUS Eee PC 1005HA-EU1X-BK</a></strong>; a last year&#8217;s model netbook sporting the following specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Atom N270 1.60GHz single core CPU, 533 MHz FSB, 32-bit</li>
<li>1x1024MB DDR2-533 @ 4-4-4-12</li>
<li>160GB 5400RPM hard drive</li>
<li>2600mAh battery rated at 4.5 hours of usage</li>
<li>Bluetooth, 802.11b/g/n</li>
<li>LED-backlit 10.1-inch screen with 1024&#215;600 resolution</li>
<li>0.3MP webcam</li>
<li>2.8 pounds</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, the <strong>more up-to-date Asus Eee PC 1005PR is an ideal choice</strong> for people reading this post and considering jumping on the netbook bandwagon. The reason? The 1005PR is among the first to sport an <strong>amazing-for-a-10-inch-screen 1366&#215;768 resolution</strong>. For comparison, the iPad has 1024&#215;768 resolution and a 13-inch MacBook boasts a 1280&#215;800 resolution. In addition, the 1005PR comes with a rated 11 hour battery life (real world ~8 hours) right out of the box, an Intel Atom N450 processor (1.66GHz, 64-bit, 667MHz FSB) and Bluetooth 2.1+EDR.</p>
<h4>The Upgrades</h4>
<p>I noticed a few things after playing around with the Eee 1005HA. While being only 92% the size of a full-size keyboard, the Eee&#8217;s keyboard makes typing surprisingly acceptable. Good enough to hammer out long emails without issue. The biggest complaint is the subpar trackpad that always gets in the way when typing, causing the cursor to move about erroneously. Fortunately there is software to enable one of the hotkey buttons to temporarily disable the trackpad while typing. Unfortunately, getting it to work in Linux is a bit hit or miss.  </p>
<p>The stock 1005HA also had a sub-par battery yielding barely 3 hours of real world usage. With these first impressions in mind I decided to order a few upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Asus_Eee_Extended_Battery" title="AGPtek 7200mAh Laptop Battery For ASUS Eee-PC">7200mAh extended battery</a> &#8211; $57</li>
<li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Logitech_Anywhere_MX_mouse" title="Logitech Anywhere MX wireless USB mouse">Logitech Anywhere MX wireless USB mouse</a> &#8211; $59</li>
<li><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Crucial_Memory_2GB_DDR2" title="Crucial DDR2 RAM 2GB">Crucial 2GB DDR2 RAM</a> &#8211; $47</li>
</ul>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_eee_upgrades_1200.jpg" title="ASUS Eee PC Upgrades - Logitech Anywhere MX mouse, Crucial 2GB RAM, extended battery"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_eee_upgrades.jpg" alt="ASUS Eee PC Upgrades - Logitech Anywhere MX mouse, Crucial 2GB RAM, extended battery"/></a><br/><small>Upgrades! RAM, Logitech mouse, extended battery</small></div>
<p>Installation was a breeze. Installing the 2GB stick of SO-DIMM DDR2 only involved removing a panel fastened by one screw. Swapping the battery out just required flipping two latches and the mouse, well that&#8217;s self-explanatory. The system was noticeably peppier with the extra RAM but I could tell the hard drive was an obvious bottleneck. I&#8217;m not quite in the mood to spend extra on an SSD for this netbook, but it&#8217;s clear that a decent SSD would make this thing much faster, but I digress.</p>
<p>The battery is quite a bit larger and heavier than the stock battery. As such a nice hump is introduced &mdash; which actually makes typing easier in my opinion. I can sacrifice a bit of weight for the 5-6 extra hours of computing time it affords me. The <strong>biggest shocker was the Logitech Anywhere MX mouse</strong>. I have been a long-time user of Logitech mice and knew about their great quality but I was blown away by this particular mouse.</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, the underside has liberal use of teflon pads meaning it <strong>glides like butter</strong>.</li>
<li>Second, it is made to be a laptop or netbook mouse. It comes with a small pouch and the USB dongle (which is already impossibly small) fits inside of the battery compartment. That being said, the USB dongle is so small there&#8217;s no reason not to keep it plugged in the netbook at all times.</li>
<li>Third, the power switch doubles as a cover for the sensor! No need to worry about damaging it when tossing it in your messenger bag as you run out the door to catch the 6:59am Caltrain Baby Bullet.</li>
<li>Fourth, the Anywhere MX is named such as its &#8220;Darkfield technology&#8221; laser sensor is accurate enough to track accurately on any surface, including glass, by looking at dust particles instead of ridges on the surface.</li>
<li>Fifth, while it can hold two AA batteries it can still function perfectly fine with just one AA installed. In short: I love this mouse so much I&#8217;ve started using it with my MacBook Pro at times (which is usually paired to a Magic Mouse).</li>
</ul>

You can easily tell the extended battery is installed in this picture.</small></div>
<h4>The Software</h4>
<p>Well we all know Windows is no fun, so that left me two options. Installing OS X (&#8220;hackintosh&#8221;) that will always be running a slightly outdated version of OS X and that I would be unable to update without having to fix something. Or I could install some distribution of Linux &mdash; be it my old favorite Gentoo, regular Ubuntu, Ubuntu Netbook Edition or one of the many distros aimed at netbooks and low horsepower PCs like <a href="http://www.geteasypeasy.com/" title="EasyPeasy Linux">EasyPeasy</a>, <a href="http://crunchbanglinux.org/" title="Crunchbang Linux">Crunchbang</a>, <a href="http://www.jolicloud.com" title="Jolicloud Netbook Linux OS">Jolicloud</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" title="Linux Mint">Linux Mint</a>, <a href="http://moblin.org" title="Moblin OS">Moblin</a> and <a href="http://www.slax.org/" title="Slax Linux OS - Slackware">Slax</a>. There is also the option of running the very-early-in-development Chromium OS but from my experience compiling that on an AMD64 computer and how slow it ended up being, I think I&#8217;ll hold off on that for now.</p>
<p>I started by researching what would be involved with installing OS X. I instantly found out that the Eee 1005HA would need a new Wi-Fi card to be compatible with OS X, so I scrapped that idea and decided to opt for some Linux distro. I ended up going with Ubuntu Netbook Edition; almost entirely for its sheer popularity which would make Googling for issues rather trivial. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_eee_ubuntu_login_gnome.jpg" alt="Logging into Ubuntu 10.04 with Gnome"/><br/><small>Logging into GNOME instead of the Netbook Edition</small></div>
<p>Installing Ubuntu involved downloading the <em>iso</em>, converting it to an <em>img</em> file and using <code style="display:inline;">dd</code> to copy it over to a USB stick. The <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/netbook/get-ubuntu/download" title="Ubuntu Netbook Edition download how to install">Ubuntu download page has a detailed guide</a> on the specifics. Windows and Linux users can have this process automated with a tool called <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/" title="UNetbootin for Linux and Windows. bootable USB drive">UNetbootin</a>.  The rest of the install process was rather trivial so I&#8217;ll spare you the details. Just be sure to enter the bios to disable fast boot (so you have time to hit ESC on boot to select the USB drive) or change your boot device order setting.</p>

Ferrari 360 Modena as spotted during a drive along Ocean Beach, SF.</small></div>
<p>After the install completed, I poked around expecting at least <em>something</em> to be broken. I&#8217;ve read lots of articles about running some Linux distro on a netbook and dealing with issues like bad video support or dead wireless or ethernet. Fortunately every critical thing worked with my setup, right out of the box! Small things like keyboard hot keys <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks#Ubuntu 10.4 Lucid Netbook Edition">require some tinkering</a> but that doesn&#8217;t bother me.</p>
<p>After poking around the new OS, installing essentials like Google Chrome and VLC player, I decided to unplug and go mobile. This is what I saw: </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_eee_pc_battery_life.jpg" alt="ASUS Eee PC battery life with new 7200mAh extended battery"/><br/><small>Finally I have a computer with more than 4 hours of battery life.</small></div>
<p>To be a truly mobile machine, there must be an easy way for me to sync and transfer my files to my primary computer. Netbooks are not meant to be a primary machine and surely can&#8217;t be for me with the limited resolution and resource bottlenecks (max RAM on the Eee 1005HA is only 2GB due to the <a href="http://ark.intel.com/chipset.aspx?familyID=35553" title="Intel 945GSE chipset">Intel 945GSE chipset</a>). My two solutions were both Internet/network-based. Right off the bat I installed the Dropbox Linux client with Nautilus integration. There&#8217;s no need for me to describe the merits and benefits of Dropbox. It just works. Create a folder to share files between my two computers and that&#8217;s it. If you use a lightweight window manager lacking Nautilus (like Fluxbox and its ilk) you&#8217;ll have to use <a href="http://wiki.dropbox.com/TipsAndTricks/AlmostText-BasedLinuxInstall" title="Dropbox for Almost Text-based Linux Install">this Dropbox hack of sorts</a>. If my primary computer was another Ubuntu box, I would have taken a good look at <a href="https://one.ubuntu.com/" title="Ubuntu One - personal cloud storage">Ubuntu One</a>.</p>
<p>My next solution was aimed at larger files. I already have a 1TB TimeCapsule ever since my Linksys WRT54G2 decided to die on me, so I might as well connect all my networked computers to it. On the netbook this involved a few simple commands:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install smbfs<br />
sudo mkdir /media/TimeCapsule<br />
sudo mount.cifs //10.0.1.1/Data/ /media/TimeCapsule -o pass=YOURPASSWORD<br />
</code></p>
<p>Replace the 10.0.1.1 IP in the last line with whatever IP your AirPort Utility application lists, supply your password and in a few seconds the Time Capsule should be mounted. I use the Time Capsule as simple network-attached storage and manually store large media files that I download with the netbook on it. The 802.11n on the Eee works pretty well so transfers don&#8217;t take too long if you don&#8217;t have an Ethernet connection handy. Which brings me to a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the netbook handle basic media, primarily video, consumption?</li>
<li>What does my downloading setup look like?</li>
</ul>
<p>The hardware in the Eee PC 1005HA is not very well suited for <em>anything</em> HD. Keep in mind that this is a year old netbook sporting a chipset from 2006. Recent netbooks like the aforementioned Eee PC 1005PR are much better suited for the task. Going back to the 1005HA, it <strong>does not play any Matroska-wrapped 720p or 1080p files</strong> at all. The audio will play and a few frames will show up here and there but definitely not watchable. Though DVD ISOs and smaller AVI files play well in VLC over Wi-Fi. However, Flash video even as low-res as 360p on YouTube was only decent, with a few frame drops and skips along with 90%+ CPU utilization.</p>

<p>In short: definitely not a media powerhouse by any means but that was to be expected.</p>
<p>Moving on, there are many options when it comes to picking a torrent or usenet client on Linux. uTorrent faithful can run the BitTorrent client under wine (not recommended) until a native Linux version is released. More popular choices on Ubuntu are Deluge and Transmission. I, however, prefer Usenet client <a href="http://hellanzb.com/trac" title="Hellanzb for Usenet">hellanzb</a> by far for my downloading needs. Pairing hellanzb with the LottaNZB GTK front-end was a no brainer and made setup as easy as installing it via Synaptic Package Manager and filling out my usenet host&#8217;s login info. At the moment I use <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Giganews_Usenet_Access" title="Giganews Usenet Access">Giganews as my Usenet provider</a></strong> with their &#8220;Diamond&#8221; plan, mainly as I want SSL and this plan also bundles in <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-toreview-surf-securely-with-vyprvpn" title="How To / Review: Surf Securely with VyprVPN">VyprVPN service, which I extensively reviewed</a> in January (more on that below).</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_lottanzb_giganews_usenet.png" alt="LottaNZB Usenet client on Ubuntu"/><br/><small>LottaNZB paired with my <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Giganews_Usenet_Access" title="Giganews Usenet">Giganews SSL account</a></small></div>
<p>I covered the basics of hellanzb in my popular article <em><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-download-with-newsgroups" title="How To: Download with Newsgroups and Usenet">How To: Download with Newsgroups</a></em> but there&#8217;s no need to get dirty with hellanzb configuration files with LottaNZB. It can do everything in the GUI if you want it to, or even an advanced configuration like monitoring a previously configured hellanzb daemon (either on the netbook or any other computer on the network). LottaNZB also automatically detects par2 and unrar binaries on your computer and can run those post-download at your discretion. Last but not least LottaNZB has a Newzbin.com plugin so you can download NZBs by simply providing a download ID number. </p>
<p>Moving on, there are a few other vital configuration items that need to be addressed before I feel comfortable in any new Linux install. Fortunately a great program called <a href="http://ubuntu-tweak.com/" title="Ubuntu Tweak">Ubuntu Tweak</a> lets me do these quickly.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_eee_ubuntu_tweak.jpg" alt="Ubuntu Tweak app"/></div>
<p>I used Ubuntu Tweak to make the default thumbnail icon size smaller, manage what programs are started upon login, adjust desktop icon settings and so on. Then I wanted to install Microsoft Truetype Fonts to make most sites look a bit better (for example a clean Ubuntu install renders Hacker News with a serif instead of the requested Verdana sans-serif).</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install msttcorefonts</code></p>
<p>And last but not least I installed <a href="http://www.marzocca.net/linux/bum.html" title="Boot-Up Manager">Boot-Up Manager</a> to remove unnecessary daemons and background services running upon boot. Every little performance tweak helps when running with a slow processor and hard drive.</p>
<p>Then I decided to see if it was possible to <strong>setup my development environment</strong> on a netbook. I installed everything I need for Notifo development, added a Redis dump, configured a few web server files and loaded up the local site. It worked. Naturally, the next question was what editor would I use to mimic my tried and true TextMate setup on OS X. After toying with various apps I ended up sticking with the default gedit, alongside some plugins like File Browser Pane and SnapOpen. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_gedit_dev_f11_1024.jpg" title="Fullscreen gedit development environment"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_gedit_dev_f11.jpg" alt="Fullscreen gedit development environment"/></a><br/><small>A fullscreen gedit development environment. Not quite textmate, but it will do when I&#8217;m away from my MacBook Pro and need to deploy some hotfixes.</small></div>
<p>Unfortunately this setup doesn&#8217;t work for me in regards to doing any real development. Screen real-estate is just too limited on this 1024&#215;600 device, even with a tiny font and fullscreen text editor. I work with Firebug quite a bit and there&#8217;s no way to use Firebug on this thing and still be able to see the website. This probably changes with the newer Asus Eee PC 1005PR and its 1366&#215;768 resolution.</p>
<h4>Going Mobile</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_eee_mobile_setup_1200.jpg" title="Paul's Mobile Netbook Setup - Eee PC, Logitech Mouse, Nexus One"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_eee_mobile_setup.jpg" alt="Paul's Mobile Netbook Setup - Eee PC, Logitech Mouse, Nexus One"/></a><br/><small>A potent yet tiny mobile setup, with the Nexus One providing Internet access where necessary.</small></div>
<p>The last piece to this puzzle is my Google/HTC Nexus One. Or just substitute that in for any 3G/etc enabled device that can tether over Wi-Fi. The Nexus One combined with Android OS v2.2 makes it incredibly easy to setup tethering with a few taps. Of course enabling tethering runs the battery down much faster, but it is more than enough for a 1 hour train ride and I can always plug it in to the netbook itself to charge. I have the Nexus One on a no-contract T-Mobile account with &#8220;unlimited Android data&#8221; and the minimum amount of minutes for about $72 USD per month including all taxes and fees. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/nexus_one_froyo_tether.jpg" alt="3G Tethering with Google Nexus One phone and Android 2.2 Froyo OS"/><br/><small>3G tethering with an Android v2.2 &#8220;Froyo&#8221; device is super easy.</small></div>
<p>As far as speeds go, I get around a megabit down and up on average with a peak at 1.53 Mbps down, 1.30 Mbps up. Enough to do check and reply to my morning emails and do some reading. Pro Tip: Readability + Feedly for Chrome are two tools you&#8217;ll want to keep in your morning commute arsenal.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/pstam_eee_readability.jpg" alt="Chrome with Readability"/><br/><small>Doing some reading in Chrome with the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jggheggpdocamneaacmfoipeehedigia" title="Google Chrome Extension - Readability Redux">Readability Redux extension</a></small></div>
<p>I also rely on one other service when I am working out of coffee shops with open Wi-Fi networks &mdash; <strong>VPN</strong>. I could always just use tethering on the Nexus One but there&#8217;s no point to limit myself to a ~1Mbps connection when there is decent Wi-Fi available. However, I don&#8217;t want to subject myself to an insecure connection. That&#8217;s where a simple VPN connection comes into play. There are tons of providers, which I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-toreview-surf-securely-with-vyprvpn" title="How To / Review: Surf Securely with VyprVPN">mentioned a few of here</a>, but I decided to use the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/VyprVPN_Service" title="VyprVPN service">VyprVPN service</a> that comes with the Giganews account I&#8217;m already paying for. </p>
<p>When I reviewed VyprVPN I was somewhat dissatisfied that they only offered not-secure-enough-for-paranoid-security-geeks PPTP VPN. Well they have since updated their offerings and now provide the option for <strong>256-bit OpenVPN SSL</strong> and thus make it easier for me to recommend. They have <a href="http://www.giganews.com/vyprvpn/openvpn/setup/?type=linux" title="Setup VyprVPN OpenVPN on Linux">detailed instructions for getting OpenVPN configured</a> with Network Manager in Ubuntu.</p>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<p>After using this netbook on a regular, though not primary, basis for the past few weeks I have to say I rather enjoy having it around. Unfortunately carrying it around with my primary 17-inch laptop en route to work wasn&#8217;t logical. Using the netbook only became handy in situations like going down the street to a local coffee shop or taking it to the couch to read up on Hacker News while watching TV. Typing on the netbook&#8217;s keyboard is almost natural and that&#8217;s the Eee&#8217;s best asset. It <em>can</em> do everything I would need from my primary machine (obviously except for heavy media stuff) but I just <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> want to do everything on it. Getting any real work done aside from replying to emails, listening to music, reading articles and otherwise browsing the web is not comfortable. If you have an iPad do you find that the case is the same?</p>
<p>In regards to the state of netbooks since my first netbooks post: it is clear that many software and hardware changes have been made in the space. There are many more netbook-geared operating systems. Unfortunately, I believe most users don&#8217;t actually want a limited experience that most of these netbook OSs are gunning for, which brings me to my next point. Netbook hardware at the moment (not the Eee I just pseudo-reviewed) is getting faster and more capable with screen resolutions good enough that there&#8217;s no reason they can&#8217;t function as primary computers for many people. Fact: I actually used a MacBook Air (which only had a 1.6GHz processor, 2GB of RAM and a slow processor sound like netbook specs?) as my only computer for a good 9 months (well, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/macbook-air-susceptible-to-gravity" title="MacBook Air Susceptible to Gravity">until I dropped it</a>). The hardware is maturing faster than the software such that it will get to the point where I believe it&#8217;s just best to use a desktop OS on it. What are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>Overall, I give my particular netbook, the Asus Eee PC 1005HA, <strong>6.5 out of 10 Stammys</strong> and 8 out of 10 Stammys for the expected benefits of a slightly beefier, current netbook with increased resolution. </p>

<h4>What to Expect</h4>
<p>This book is not a one-stop shop for all your HTML5-related needs. It&#8217;s an <strong>introductory resource</strong> aimed at showing you a snippet of the new functionality contained within HTML5 and the reasoning behind it with a dabble of example code. Not much more than that. It scratches the surface &mdash; enough for you to know what you want to use to do something in your next project and point you in the right direction with how to get started and research more.  That being said I was a little disappointed upon flipping through the pages of the book when it arrived. I wanted to see sections about things like geolocation, drag and drop, Web Storage, Web SQL Database, Web Workers, WebSockets and so on. </p>
<p>Instead I was greeted with this quote in the book:</p>
<blockquote><p>The [JavaScript] APIs in HTML5 are very powerful. They are also completely over my head. I&#8217;ll leave it to developers smarter than me to write about them. The APIs deserve their own separate book.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. Those are rather technical subjects and this is an introductory book. I can live with that. In fact, the first chapters of the the book cleared up many misconceptions about what the HTML5 spec actually encompasses. Many people lump things together in the HTML5 buzzword. Web Storage isn&#8217;t even in the HTML5 spec, but I had to read Mark Pilgrim&#8217;s <em><a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/" title="Dive into HTML 5 by Mark Pilgrim">Dive Into HTML 5</a></em> to learn that nugget:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Web Storage] was at one time part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out onto its own specification for uninteresting political reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>Author Jeremy Keith, whose DOM Scripting and Bulletproof Ajax books have been in my arsenal for several years, sets out to explain some of the more landmark structure and feature changes in HTML5 while keeping the book far from a boring technical read: </p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose there&#8217;s an evil bastard out there who hates the web and all who sail her. This person probably doesn&#8217;t care that it&#8217;s incredibly rude and stupid to embed an audio file that plays automatically. Thanks to the <code style="display:inline;">autoplay</code> attribute, such malevolent ambitions can be realized</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t quite read like an O&#8217;Reilly book. I like that.</p>
<h4>Chapter Breakdown</h4>
<p><em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> is separated into the following chapters. I took some notes while reading and will attempt to clean them up and present you with some broad takeaways for each. This is not a summary of the book and some sections are left out. I recommend you snatch a copy the book to get the bigger picture. I just want to <strong>share what I learned</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Brief History of Markup</li>
<li>The Design of HTML5</li>
<li>Rich Media</li>
<li>Web Forms 2.0</li>
<li>Semantics</li>
<li>Using HTML5 Today</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Brief History of Markup</strong><br />
The first two chapters setup the history of HTML and provide some good insight into the rather confusing space of HTML5. Keith begins all the way back in 1991 with Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposing the original HTML spec, which started at version 2.0. Mentions of the Internet Engineering Task Force, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) intertwine with mentions of Web Apps 1.0, XHTML 1.0, HTML 4.01 and lots more specifications and version numbers. The current state of HTML5 emerges &mdash; the WHATWG and W3C HTML Working Group are both working on the HTML5 specification in a still-complicated manner.</p>
<p><strong>The Design of HTML5</strong><br />
HTML5 is all about backwards compatibility &mdash; supporting existing content. Lots of emphasis on how changing existing user behavior is  just about impossible. A key point of this chapter that sets the tone for the book starts with the description of the relatively simple HTML5 doctype and character encoding: </p>
<p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code><br />
<code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code></p>
<p>From that Keith ascertains that HTML5 places less importance on versions and more importance on backwards compatibility &mdash; browsers support features, not doctypes. Likewise, other facets of the syntax have been simplified. You no longer need to specify <code style="display:inline;">text/javascript</code> or <code style="display:inline;">text/css</code> for script or CSS inclusions, respectively.</p>
<p><em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> mentions how in the favor of backwards compatibility and supporting existing content (starting to see the trend here?) that certain elements are being marked as <em>obsolete</em>, not deprecated, in HTML5. These obsolete elements include <code style="display:inline;">frame</code>, <code style="display:inline;">frameset</code>, <code style="display:inline;">noframes</code>, <code style="display:inline;">acronym</code>, <code style="display:inline;">font</code>, <code style="display:inline;">big</code>, <code style="display:inline;">center</code>, <code style="display:inline;">strike</code>, <code style="display:inline;">bgcolor</code>, <code style="display:inline;">cellspacing</code>, <code style="display:inline;">cellpadding</code>, <code style="display:inline;">valign</code> and <code style="display:inline;">big</code>. Meanwhile, certain elements like <code style="display:inline;">small</code>,  <code style="display:inline;">b</code>,  <code style="display:inline;">i</code> and  <code style="display:inline;">cite</code> received an update in their meaning in regards to how each one bestows importance and semantics upon their contents. Keith also mentioned how the <code style="display:inline;">a</code> element now officially supports wrapping multiple non-<code style="display:inline;">a</code> elements in a single <code style="display:inline;">a</code> element in HTML5, even though browsers have been able to do this for a while already.</p>
<p>The chapter ends on a brief mention about JavaScript APIs like drag and drop and UndoManager that HTML5 will document, but there&#8217;s no diving deeper into that subject matter. </p>
<p><strong>Rich Media</strong><br />
<code style="display:inline;">Canvas</code>, <code style="display:inline;">audio</code> and <code style="display:inline;">video</code> make their appearance in chapter 3. These elements bring native rich media support to the browser without the use of plug-ins like Flash or Silverlight, but they are not without their caveats. The canvas element lacks a DOM and as such is less accessible to screen readers unless used in certain, less advantageous manners. Aside from that (rather large) nitpick, canvas seems to hold much promise. It currently only has a 2D API, currently capable of JavaScript actions like strokes, fills, gradients, shadows, shapes and Bezier curves that can be run at any time. Keith suggests thinking about canvas as an environment for creating dynamic images.</p>
<p><code style="display:inline;">Audio</code> and <code style="display:inline;">video</code> are easier to begin using right off the bat but it is quickly realized that browser limitations force developers to encode different versions of media as well as include fallback content to cover all the bases. Boolean attributes (not the same as Boolean values) are touched upon. Just think of them like how putting &#8220;checked&#8221; in an input checkbox changes its value, regardless of whether &#8220;checked&#8221; is set to anything. The audio element has several of these Boolean attributes: autoplay, loop, controls. The audio player is scriptable via calling functions like play() on the element. Meanwhile, the video element is both scriptable <em>and</em> styleable.</p>
<p><strong>Web Forms 2.0</strong><br />
The fourth chapter has many sections introducing and showing off new elements and features for forms &mdash; perhaps the most interesting section for web application developers by far. And it is with that declaration that I point out the <code style="display:inline;">placeholder</code> attribute for input field. If you&#8217;ve ever had to do something like this:</p>
<p><code>onfocus="if (this.value=='Search') this.value=' ';" onblur="if (this.value=='') this.value='Search';"</code></p>
<p>Then you&#8217;ll immediately know what placeholder does. It replaces the need for that JS snippet &mdash; in supported browsers. This is where Jeremy takes the time to check whether an element supports that attribute. This is done many times in the chapter and reinforces the motif that working with HTML5 is more about <strong><em>feature detection</em> rather than browser detection</strong>. This is touched on more in the last chapter.</p>
<p>Other elements discussed include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code style="display:inline;">autofocus</code></li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">required</code> &mdash; Boolean attribute for input fields (think form validation)</li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">autocomplete</code> &mdash; Boolean value to tell browsers whether or not they should automatically fill in forms if they have the data (for example, tell a credit card number text input field not to automatically fill)</li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">datalist</code> &mdash; hybrid between <code style="display:inline;">input</code> and <code style="display:inline;">select</code>. Provides a drop-down of items while typing text into an input or while focused, which users may use to click on the item they want.</li>
<li>many new input types: <code style="display:inline;">search</code>, <code style="display:inline;">email</code>, <code style="display:inline;">tel</code>, <code style="display:inline;">url</code>, <code style="display:inline;">range</code> (slider!), <code style="display:inline;">spinner</code>, <code style="display:inline;">date</code>, <code style="display:inline;">datetime</code>, <code style="display:inline;">datetime-local</code>, <code style="display:inline;">time</code>, <code style="display:inline;">month</code>, <code style="display:inline;">week</code>, <code style="display:inline;">color</code> and <code style="display:inline;">pattern</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, there&#8217;s a smattering of Keith&#8217;s quips. In regards to how type=&#8221;date&#8221; brings up a native calendar display:</p>
<blockquote><p>Opera implements these input types using its patented ugly-stick technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>And about using the pattern attribute (regular expression):</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of the time, you&#8217;ll never need to use the pattern attribute. On the occasions that you do, you have my sympathy.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Semantics</strong><br />
Chapter 5 is the beefiest chapter in the short pamphlet-like book and with good reason; it discusses new structure changes in HTML5 with a focus on bridging the gap between machine-readable and human-readable markup. There&#8217;s some talk of microformats and how they were an early attempt at web-based semantic markup and dataformats by utilizing present technologies, like simply adding particular class names to elements.</p>
<p>Several new elements are introduced again. </p>
<ul>
<li><code style="display:inline;">mark</code> &mdash; like highlighting a certain snippet of content without attaching any semantic importance to it</li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">time</code></li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">meter</code> &mdash; for measurements</li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">progress</code> &mdash; like meter but more for dynamically changing values. scriptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the pieces that might take a second to grok are in the <strong>structure</strong> section of this chapter. While at first they may just seem like new elements to use in place of divs that you already use, they will provide web browsers (that support it) with &#8220;a completely new way of understanding your content.&#8221; Using these elements isn&#8217;t always as simple as say, replacing your <code style="display:inline;">&lt;div id="header"&gt;</code> with <code style="display:inline;">&lt;header&gt;</code>. These new semantic elements place importance on <em>content</em> rather than <em>position</em> and it is as such that Keith provided a few examples of how a footer element would make sense to mark up author information that is positioned inside of a sidebar.</p>
<ul>
<li><code style="display:inline;">section</code> &mdash; used to group related content</li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">header</code> &mdash; container for a group of introductory or navigational aids. document can have multiple header elements. typical to use header within section.</li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">footer</code> &mdash; info about author of main content, links to related content and so on</li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">aside</code> &mdash; related content but separate from main content</li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">nav</code> &mdash; list of links for major navigational info and sitewide nav. typically used within header element.</li>
<li><code style="display:inline;">article</code> &mdash; self-contained related content designed for syndication. think blog posts</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least was an explanation about <strong>content models</strong> and the new outlining algorithm. Inline elements are now known as text-level semantics, block level elements like lists, divs and paragraphs are grouping content, forms are their own content model, new structural elements listed above are sectioning content while images, audio, video and canvas are being referred to as embedded content.</p>
<p>Things get a bit trickier when talking about sectioning content and outlines:</p>
<blockquote><p>In HTML5, each piece of sectioning content has its own self-contained outline. That means that you don&#8217;t have to keep track of what heading level you should be using&mdash;you can just start from h1 each time</p></blockquote>
<p>Each piece of sectioned content can have its own header element and other headings; several times on the same page. This means you don&#8217;t have to many levels of headings to get the desired nesting. Use sections to divide it up and start each one as if it were a new page, if that makes sense. Then you can use the <code style="display:inline;">hgroup</code> element to ensure that only the first heading listed contributes to the outline. An example use case would be having a website title heading and tagline within an hgroup inside of a header element.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t describe the concept as well as Jeremy did without going into lots of detail, so I&#8217;ll leave it at that. Certain elements called sectioning roots are not subject to the outline algorithm: <code style="display:inline;">blockquote</code>, <code style="display:inline;">td</code>, <code style="display:inline;">fieldset</code>. You can imagine how that works out.</p>
<p><strong>Using HTML5 Today</strong><br />
In short, you can&#8217;t use everything you just learned right away and expect it to work in good chunk of modern (as of this writing) browsers. Instead, <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> enforces good practice by using tools like <a href="http://www.modernizr.com/" title="Modernizr">Modernizr</a> to detect supported features in browsers and use new features where supported, gracefully degrading where not supported. You can start by updating to the new doctype and getting in the habit of using new semantic elements by changing the classes of your divs to section, header, aside and so on. When the time comes that HTML5 has better support in browsers, you can simply go back and switch to actually using those elements. </p>
<h4>Other HTML5 Resources</h4>
<p>While <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> is among the very first HTML5 books to hit shelves, several others from reputable publishers are coming later this summer. However, I will go out on a limb and say most will not be as brief and easy a read as <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em>.  After reading it though, I definitely want to learn more and feel like this book barely touched the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<h4>Verdict</h4>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/abookapart_html5_layout.jpg" alt="HTML5 for Web Designers - Layout"/><br/><small>Lovely typography and whitespace galore</small></div>
<p>I give <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> <strong><meter min="0" value="8.5" max="10">8.5 out of 10</meter> Stammys</strong>. Oh and I just used the <a href="http://html5doctor.com/measure-up-with-the-meter-tag/">HTML5 <code style="display:inline;">meter</code> tag</a> on that rating, as mentioned in the book. The book is a well-designed quick and simple read, if a little too beginner-oriented. I would have liked to see more discussion about JavaScript browser APIs and some more in-depth examples along with included code on a website somewhere. At <strong>$18 + shipping</strong> for a slim book, you might double-think about whether <em>HTML5 for Web Designers</em> is actually worth it for you. </p>
<p>On an related note, <strong>do you buy technical books anymore</strong> or rely on the Internet? I used to be an avid consumer/reader of technical reference books and bought at least one every other month for years. Then I started realizing that they would remain on my bookshelf &mdash; and become outdated &mdash; as I would simply Google for whatever I needed.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on HTML5? How about the HTML5 buzzword collective.. CSS3 and related JS APIs? What do you think about this book?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I was not given an advance press copy as other bloggers have been. I bought this myself and decided to write about it on my own. I have no affiliation with the author or publisher. If you read this far, grats! Leave a comment saying something smart about anything web dev/HTML5/etc related and if I like your comment I will send you the book I just reviewed. </p>

Notifo uses push &mdash; a lightning fast notification technology made possible by the flux capacitor powered by 1.21 jiggawatts &mdash; so I will get your message on my iPhone usually in under 3 seconds. We decided to make it the first of a bunch of examples/projects that will go on a future Notifo &#8220;Labs&#8221; site. You can <a href="http://gist.github.com/458296" title="wish stammy happy birthday - gist github">view the PHP source here</a> to see how it&#8217;s done and begin tinkering on your own.</p>
<p><strong>For the next 24 hours</strong>, on my 24th birthday you can send me a message to my phone using Notifo. Cheers!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and subscribing to my blog over the years! <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com" title="Paul">PaulStamatiou.com</a> turns 5 years old sometime in August. If you have yet to subscribe, head over to my sidebar and take your pick of email or RSS. I&#8217;m actually using <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-notifo/" title="WP-Notifo - Notifo for WordPress">WP-Notifo</a> so technically you can also subscribe to this blog on Notifo as well but I need to spend a few seconds to add the widget first. I know I haven&#8217;t been blogging as much in the last year; been keeping busy with work but hopefully the articles I write are useful and informative. My recent move to San Francisco has been amazing and I am loving it out here. Some great things to come&#8230;</p>
<p>Best,<br />

While some newer routers come with a USB port allowing users to add a hard drive or printer on the network, they are costly and rather limited in their functionality. It was this dilemma that had me pondering a custom solution when I wrote my <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/diy-200-dollar-pc" title="DIY $200 PC, server, NAS">series about building a cheap and small mini-ITX-based computer</a> with the sole purpose of being a NAS and download box. That setup cost over $200 and required much hardware and software tinkering. For those looking for a cheaper and hassle-free solution, I would suggest the <a href="http://tonidoplug.com" title="TonidoPlug">$99 TonidoPlug</a> linux home server, NAS, cloud-in-a-plug&#8230; et cetera. </p>

<p><span id="more-7129"></span></p>
<p>The <strong>TonidoPlug falls into a relatively new category of &#8220;wall-wart&#8221; form factor computers</strong>. They are generally defined as being cheap, low on power consumption (in the single watts range) and fanless. Most plug computers, as they are also called, are based off of the <a href="http://www.plugcomputer.org/" title="Plug Computer - Marvell SheevaPlug">Marvell SheevaPlug reference design</a>. The difference between the TonidoPlug competitors like the <a href="http://www.ctera.com/home/ctera-cloudplug.html" title="Ctera CloudPlug">Ctera CloudPlug</a>, <a href="http://www.pogoplug.com/" title="PogoPlug">PogoPlug</a> and <a href="http://www.globalscaletechnologies.com/c-4-guruplugs.aspx" title="Globalscale GuruPlug">Globalscale GuruPlug</a> comes down to the bundled software and services. While they all essentially run on the same hardware, each has its own set of pre-installed applications in addition to services (some are paid) that do things like facilitate file and media sharing from outside the home network.</p>
<p>Tonido bills their offering as &#8220;<strong>an alternative to cloud services and storage</strong>.&#8221; I think Tonido is going after some stiff competition with services like Dropbox and Amazon S3 for file storage/syncing and countless other cloud services for every niche imaginable, that<strong> don&#8217;t rely on cheap commodity hardware that has a much higher chance of failing</strong> compared to aforementioned cloud services with SLAs. But I digress; for what is essentially a $99 network-connected Linux box, I couldn&#8217;t resist taking a look at the TonidoPlug.</p>
<h4>Hardware</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tonidoplug_closeup_desk_1200.jpg" title="TonidoPlug Linux Home Server and NAS closeup"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tonidoplug_closeup_desk.jpg" alt="TonidoPlug Linux Home Server and NAS closeup"/></a></div>
<p>At roughly the size of the last-generation Apple Mac Mini (the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Apple_Mac_Mini" title="Apple Mac Mini">new version of which</a> is slick as heck) power brick itself, the TonidoPlug comes with a <strong>1.2GHz</strong> Marvell Feroceon processor (ARMv5), 512 MB of DDR2 RAM, 512 MB of flash storage (Hynix NAND using JFFS2 according to dmesg), a gigabit Ethernet port and a single USB 2.0 port (Marvell Orion EHCI). Sorry, no Wi-Fi in this plug computer&#8230; though the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5440702/marvell-plug-computer-30-the-tiny-linux-brick" title="Marvell Plug Computer 3.0 tiny Linux brick">updated version of the Marvell reference design</a> includes 802.11b/g, bluetooth, a 2.0 GHz processor and built-in hard drive. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tonidoplug_setup_desk_1200.jpg" title="TonidoPlug complete setup with external Western Digital hard drive"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tonidoplug_setup_desk.jpg" alt="TonidoPlug complete setup with external Western Digital hard drive"/></a></div>
<p>As for power consumption the TonidoPlug has been said to draw approximately 5 to 13 Watts though I cannot confirm without a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Kill-a-Watt-Monitor" title="P3 Kill A Watt Electricity Load Meter and Monitor">Kill-a-Watt meter</a> handy. The fanless design is silent at the expense of being warm to the touch, neighboring on toasty when performing a rather large apt-get update. Overall, the TonidoPlug is a nice, simple server I can hide anywhere, such as right on my power strip.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tonidoplug_cable_mess_1200.jpg" title="TonidoPlug Linux Computer plugged into a surge protector"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tonidoplug_cable_mess.jpg" alt="TonidoPlug Linux Computer plugged into a surge protector"/></a><br/><small>The TonidoPlug nestled away in its natural habitat &mdash; the majestic power strip.</small></div>
<p>Assuming the TonidoPlug is always running near its load (only likely if you were to do something like <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/" title="Folding @ Home - Stanford">fold</a> on it 24/7), it would cost $1.42 to run for a month in California (15.22 cents per kW-h according to the <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/electricity/epm/table5_6_b.html" rel="nofollow">DOE</a>). </p>
<h4>Software</h4>
<p>Like its ilk, the TonidoPlug does not include any sort of monitor or display connector. As a network device and server more than a desktop, the plug computer is meant to be accessed through a web interface (or SSH if you prefer&#8230; or you can setup VNC if you must). The underlying operating system on the TonidoPlug is Ubuntu 9.04, but seeing as how users have access to SSH and apt-get (though it is <a href="http://computingplugs.com/index.php/Fixing_apt-get" title="Fixing apt-get for plug computer">broken right out of the box</a>) this can be user-updated whenever necessary. This is where Tonido shows off what it can do. CodeLathe, the folks behind Tonido, have developed a web interface and suite of applications. The <strong>larger goal is to get developers to build other applications for inclusion in Tonido&#8217;s own app store</strong>. Tonido has a <a href="http://www.tonido.com/what_tonido_platform.html" title="Tonido Developer Platform">well-documented developer platform</a> and SDK out for this purpose. That being said it appears they are still in the early stages of fostering this developer community and the only applications out are ones written by CodeLathe.</p>
<p>Before delving into those TonidoPlug web applications I&#8217;ll talk about setup. Hardware setup doesn&#8217;t really warrant a mention &mdash; just plug it in, attach an Ethernet connection and USB storage device, be it a USB stick or external hard drive. Software setup is almost as easy. Find the local IP of your TonidoPlug on the network by going to tonidoplug.com/ip  then access that in your browser; the URL is usually something like <em>http://[local IP]:10001</em>. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tonidoplug_hw_setup_wizard.jpg" alt="TonidoPlug Hardware Setup Wizard"/></div>
<p>After changing the root password (you use also this for SSH access later on if you so choose) you will be prompted to create a Tonido account. This account is vital to accessing your TonidoPlug outside of the network by simply browsing to your easy-to-remember Tonido URL. That&#8217;s pretty much it for setup. </p>

<p>There are two main UIs for the Tonido. There is the admin interface that provides control and lets you see the status of hardware, network and storage, and then there is the primary interface for managing applications. You&#8217;ll spend most of your time in the latter.</p>

<p>At this point, without any further configuration you can connect to your USB drive on the network. Samba is pre-configured and already running. WebDAV support is also available, but after setting up the included WebsharePro application. This brings me to the next point: applications. Currently the TonidoPlug comes with a slew of applications: </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that all of the <strong>included applications would never replace my current usage of other services</strong> or applications for their respective utilities. The Tonido apps are all minimum viable products at best and do not compare to other feature-rich web or desktop applications. Even if these included TonidoPlug applications were up to par with other competing cloud services, I <strong>would not trust my daily workflow on a cheap piece of hardware</strong> that could stop working at anytime and that relies on a home Internet connection that is just as unreliable. The main draw of the TonidoPlug is the Tonido service that lets users access these applications and their files remotely, outside of their network but in the end that introduces another failure point &mdash; the home Internet connection.  That&#8217;s where the Money and Workspace-like apps make no sense to me. On the other hand I have <strong>no problem using the TonidoPlug to serve up local media files</strong> and the TonidoPlug&#8217;s ability to stream media to UPnP and DLNA compliant devices like the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are enticing.  </p>
<h4>So what <em>do</em> I like?</h4>
<p>I could expand on my thoughts but there&#8217;s no convincing me otherwise. If I am to use a so-called cloud alternative to store my files it would not be in the form of a $99 piece of hardware. I have become far too used to happily relying on robust cloud services like Amazon S3, 37 Signals web apps, my own server for OpenID purposes, WordPress for blogging, desktop applications uTorrent/Unison for downloading and so on. In short, I already have something that does each of the things better than the Tonido apps are meant for.  There is <strong>one big exception</strong> though. Tonido has an app store and more useful applications and innovative TonidoPlug uses could emerge based on new applications.</p>
<p>However, the TonidoPlug is still valuable to me at the moment, despite my disappointment with the applications. Why is that? It&#8217;s a <strong>$99 linux computer that is perfect for small projects</strong>. For example, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=hackers-weigh-in-mini-server" title="Hackers Weigh In: 8 Big Things to Do with a Mini Server">Scientific American asked some MIT and CMU students how they would use</a> such a cheap and small server. There are some great ideas in there from home automation to remote video surveillance or anything really:</p>
<blockquote><p>8. You name it:<br />
Because SheevaPlug uses the Linux operating system and open-source software (both of which can be downloaded for free), it could be a cheap Web server, a source-code repository, a backup server or countless other things. &#8220;In general,&#8221; M.I.T.&#8217;s Hutchinson says, &#8220;it would be possible to host a lot of different types of services on such a box.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tonidoplug_simple_hd_1200.jpg" title="TonidoPlug NAS setup with external Western Digital hard drive"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tonidoplug_simple_hd.jpg" alt="TonidoPlug NAS setup with external Western Digital hard drive"/></a><br/><small><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2TB_Western_Digital_My_Book" title="2TB Western Digital MyBook Elite external USB 2.0 hard drive">2TB Western Digital My Book Elite</a> hard drive not included.</small></div>
<p>For $99 I would recommend the TonidoPlug to any hardware and software hacker looking for another platform to tinker around with. I&#8217;m already thinking about using it to control an RFID reader and some software to manage a door solenoid lock in addition to sending out access alerts via Notifo. However that would be made much easier if this had Wi-Fi built-in like the updated reference design. </p>
<p>The TonidoPlug gets <strong>8 out of 10 Stammys</strong> for great value for a small Linux server, not so much for the bundled apps. I will be keeping an eye on Tonido and its app store to see when things change for the better.</p>
<p><strong>What would you do with a TonidoPlug? Would you buy one? Do you currently own any similar network devices or tiny servers?</strong></p>

I had no idea what I wanted to shift my full-time focus to and began connecting with people, researching and interviewing with a handful of companies &mdash; ranging from huge web presences all the way down to tiny startups. I considered companies in different spaces from finance all the way to video. I met with dozens of folks to see what they were up to and what their company was about. That led to me being wired on caffeine for a few weeks when I had 3-4 coffee meetings scheduled each day, but I digress. I am elated to announce, likely to the surprise of many, that last week I jumped onboard <span id="more-7153"></span> the smallest company I chatted with &mdash; <strong>Notifo</strong>. </p>
<p>Notifo recently graduated from the Winter 2010 batch of the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/about.html" title="Y Combinator">Y Combinator</a> startup incubator run by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(computer_programmer)" title="Paul Graham">Paul Graham</a>, <a href="http://www.foundersatwork.com/author.html" title="Founders at Work - Jessica Livingston">Jessica Livingston</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris" title="Robert Morris">Robert Morris (rtm)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell" title="Trevor Blackwell">Trevor Blackwell</a> (who spends his time working on <a href="http://anybots.com/" title="Anybots">Anybots</a>). My <strong>title is Co-Founder</strong> alongside <a href="http://twitter.com/jazzychad" title="Chad Etzel on Twitter">Chad Etzel</a> (also a Georgia Tech Alum). We recently closed an <strong>angel round</strong>.</p>
<h4>What&#8217;s it do?</h4>
<p>Notifo is a <strong>mobile notifications platform</strong> that consists of two parts: the backend to serve up hot <em>PUSH</em> notifications rapidly and mobile clients to interact with them. Notifo currently has an iPhone app but will be expanding to Android next, then other smartphones. The biggest draw of Notifo is that people can send notifications to mobile clients without having to personally develop mobile apps, a time consuming and expensive process. Instead, users just have the free Notifo app which can be used to receive notifications from a number of services that use <a href="https://api.notifo.com/" title="Notifo API">the simple API</a> (post over https with basic auth).</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/notifo_iphone_app.jpg" alt="Notifo iPhone App Screenshots"/></a><br/><small>An example notification coming from GitHub and then the listing of other notifications in the Notifo app.</small></div>
<p>Version 2 of the iPhone app is currently under beta testing with a scheduled release in the next month (after compatibility testing with iOS 4). It will feature some interesting features with utility adjacent to notifications that will be driving our early user adoption. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/notifo_devices.jpg" alt="Notifo Devices"/></a><br/><small>Doing mobile dev means we will need to have many devices on hand to test various builds of the application. Ex: for Android we need something that runs 2.2 for c2dm (Android&#8217;s push) as well as some older versions to test a pre-c2dm workaround.</small></div>
<p>The flow of things is that the user creates an account on the site or within the application (currently only the iPhone app is public and released) then signs up for services and grants them permission to notify them. At the moment there aren&#8217;t <em>too</em> many services, which explains why I will be doing some sorts of developer evangelism with various how to articles and coding up various neat scripts as mentioned below. </p>
<p>Below you&#8217;ll see some of the individual controls users have on each service they receive notifications from. There is also a page (not shown) where you can set things like quiet hours.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/hn_notifo_settings.jpg" alt="Notifo Settings for Hacker News"/><br/><small>The Hacker News service (add Notifo username to HN user profile) notifies you of replies to your HN comments.</small></div>
<h4>What do you do?</h4>
<p>I will be doing what I love doing &mdash; a bit of <em>everything</em>. Traditionally this has been mainly front-end tasks but as I have never touched mobile development, I&#8217;m eager to learn and help out where I can. For example, random things I have been working on include a Google Chrome extension to send the current page to the phone (similar to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chrometophone/" title="Google Chrome to Phone">chrome to phone</a> functionality but that was Android-only), a Safari 5 Extension, adding functionality to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-notifo/" title="WordPress Plugin for Notifo">Notifo WordPress plugin</a> created by Hacker News user <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ErrantX" rel="nofollow" title="Hacker News user profile ErrantX">ErrantX</a> in addition to various things around the Notifo web app, including some PHP/Redis tinkering and lots of aesthetic improvements. I also have been planning on making a section of the site to promote interesting uses of the Notifo API and services from those in the development community.</p>
<h4>How you can get started with the Notifo API</h4>
<p>On Monday GitHub added my Notifo service hook. This allows any repository admin to specify a CSV list of Notifo usernames to be notified upon each commit to that repository.  GitHub has information on how to start working with service hooks on their <code style="display:inline;">github-services</code> repository page lthat they want people to fork.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/notifo_github.jpg" alt="Notifo Service Hook on GitHub"/><br/><small><strong>Notifo Service Hook</strong> now live on GitHub. Just click the Admin button for a repo you own then scroll to Service Hooks.</small></div>
<p>I&#8217;ll briefly go over what was involved with creating a Notifo service hook and using the API. First off, there are two types of accounts on Notifo: user accounts and service accounts. User accounts may subscribe to service accounts in addition to being able to send notifications to themselves without needing to send a subscription request first. Service accounts may send messages to any user but those users must first accept a subscription request sent by the service. Notifications sent from a user account to that user cannot change the avatar shown when the notification is received. Both types of accounts have their own API secret key that must be used in conjunction with the username before interacting with the API. In addition, interacting with the API must be done over HTTPS.</p>
<p>In the case of the GitHub service hook, we decided to use a service account for GitHub so that there can be multiple subscribers and so that everyone would see the lovely squidcat icon (avatar set inside the Notifo website). ;-) </p>
<p><small><script src="http://gist.github.com/439856.js?file=Notifo%20GitHub%20Service"></script></small></p>
<p>This particular script is in Ruby and two loops are taking place. In the first loop I run through the CSV list of subscribers (Notifo usernames) that is specified on an external file, open an HTTP connection and specify basic authentication and SSL to the <code style="display:inline;">subscribe_user</code> API URL and send a POST consisting of the username. That sends a subscription request to the user &mdash; required or the user won&#8217;t receive subsequent notifications. In this case the user will end up missing the first commit notification but it will work for the second after they accept the request.</p>
<p>The second loop is nested within the first and sends the actual notification to the user. In this case we want to sent information about the repository commit. The external payload contains that information so I&#8217;m merely passing along that data in some of the parameters for a <code style="display:inline;">send_notification</code>: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>to</strong> &#8211; the Notifo username</li>
<li><strong>msg</strong> &#8211; the commit message </li>
<li><strong>title</strong> &#8211; repository name and branch </li>
<li><strong>uri</strong> &#8211; the GitHub commit page, opened when the user double-taps on the notification (a single tap expands the message; useful for long commit messages)</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters must be URL encoded so that explains the long URI.escape chunks. There are tons of ways of URL encoding and escaping strings though. In summary: for a service account establish HTTPS connection with basic auth utilizing service name and API secret key, loop through users, send subscription notification request then the send message.</p>
<p>How about an <strong>example for sending a notification to the user</strong> from their own user account? Let&#8217;s tackle that in JavaScript:</p>
<p><small><script src="http://gist.github.com/440273.js?file=Notifo%20JS%20example%3A%20Send%20message%20to%20user%20from%20their%20own%20user%20account"></script></small></p>
<p>This example comes from the Chrome extension I was hacking away on so that <a href="http://www.rajdeepd.com/articles/chrome/localstrg/LocalStorageSample.htm" title="Google Chrome HTML5 localStorage">localStorage stuff</a> probably isn&#8217;t relevant to you. Just hardcode or require parameters for the username and API secret key instead of taking them from localStorage. Creating basic authentication in JavaScript requires setting the authorization header and sending the base64 encoded hash of the &#8220;username:key&#8221; token. Calling <code style="display:inline;">Base64.encode()</code> requires a base64 encode/decode library to be included within the page.  I open the connection to send a POST to send_notification() with some parameters. The only difference about sending a notification from a user account is an optional code style=&#8221;display:inline;&#8221;>label</code> to describe the application. Note that this was simply a quick JS example and there is more that should be done for production code. Also, due to same-origin security policy there is a JavaScript dilemma with doing cross-domain POST requests that involves a tricky setup. A quick search on StackOverflow should yield a few of the ways to get past that.</p>
<p>How about an <strong>example in PHP</strong>? Here's the function WP-Notifo uses to send notifications:</p>
<p><small><script src="http://gist.github.com/440293.js?file=WP-Notifo%20notifo_message%28%29"></script></small></p>
<p>You can start to see similarities between all these pieces of code. The only real difference between everything is how each particular language sends the actual POST. The above examples were the vanilla plain examples and did not make use of any handy API libraries. Notifo currently has a few API libraries on this <a href="http://github.com/notifo/Notifo-API-Libraries" title="Notifo on GitHub">GitHub repo page</a> with libraries for more languages to come. Don't see a library for your language of choice? Fork it, code it and submit a pull request.</p>
<h4>The Office</h4>
<p>Chad and I <strong>work out of a garage</strong> in Menlo Park. I brought my own desk to work the first day. As for what the startup life is like &mdash; it's absolutely brilliant working next to a smart person for hours on end. I woke up at 5:50am my first full day, went to work and got home at 11pm. The second day started just as early. In a startup no one benefits from you slacking. It's not about reaching 5pm or 6pm and clocking out; it's about moving fast, completing your objectives and creating passionate users. (and then exiting, working for Google and enjoying their sweet, <em>sweet</em> froyo machine in Building 43 everyday).</p>

<p>There's a lot more I could say here but this blog post started out with the intent of just being a simple announcement. I'll save the more thought-out blog posts about product development and technical talk for the near future. Keep up-to-date on Notifo happenings with the <a href="http://blog.notifo.com/" title="Notifo blog">company blog</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/notifo" title="Notifo on Twitter">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts? Questions about working with the Notifo and/or the API? What would you like to build out to test Notifo? Any improvements to the API or product concept in general?</strong></p>

There seems to be two camps when it comes to the iPhone 4 &mdash; those that love it and those that hate it. Actually, it is more like three; love, hate and those that aren&#8217;t exactly sold on it but will buy it anyway. I have been onboard with the last 3 iPhones and waited in long lines on launch day to get most of them. However, I <strong>won&#8217;t be getting the iPhone 4</strong> this time around.</p>

If you want juicier details head over to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/07/iphone-4-announced/" title="iPhone 4 Announced">Engadget</a>, <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/06/07/live-steve-jobs-keynote-at-wwdc" title="Live Steve Jobs Keynote at WWDC">Mashable</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/06/iphone-4-unveiled-gets-hd-video-led-flash-dual-cameras.ars" title="iPhone 4 Unveiled, gets HD Video, LED flash, dual cameras">ArsTechnica</a>, et cetera.</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 4 comes in <strong>16GB and 32GB</strong> flavors in white and black. Priced at $199 and $299 respectively. <strong>AT&#038;T only</strong>.</li>
<li>Lots of emphasis on new <strong>960&#215;640 IPS LCD display</strong>: 800:1 contrast ratio and 326ppi. Dubbed &#8220;retina&#8221; display for clever metaphor that human eye can&#8217;t see individual pixels so tightly packed together. Display is still familiar 3.5-inch size. For comparison, the massive 4.3-inch display on the <strong>HTC EVO 4G only packs in 800&#215;480 resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>Processor is 1GHz A4 chip which makes room for a <strong>larger battery</strong>: 40% increase in talk time. Am I  the only one that thinks modern smartphones should no longer be judged on this talk time metric? Talking on a smartphone is only a small percentage of what many use their smartphones for now.</li>
<li><strong>No 4G</strong> or LTE&#8230; which is why the iPhone is called 4 and not 4G. Many people would confused the 4G moniker for 4G cellular wireless standards-based technology, not fourth generation iPhone. While there is no 4G, Apple packed in Quad-Band HDSPA/HSUPA data modems.</li>
<li>Three-axis gyroscope.. most important for new games. If only Apple spent less time on hardware sensors for gaming and more time on utility. The iPhone <strong>still doesn&#8217;t come with a turn-by-turn navigation</strong> app. Google Maps Navigation is great on Android phones.</li>
<li><strong>Dual cameras</strong> &#8211; VGA on front, autofocus 5MP with single LED flash on rear. Rear camera records<strong> 720p HD at 30fps</strong> (Compare to only 25fps 720 on EVO 4G). Rear lens is slightly more wide-angle than the iPhone 3GS&#8217;s lens. Photos appear to be good but won&#8217;t know for sure until the reviews emerge. iMovie app announced for $5.</li>
<li>iBooks coming to iPhone; supports PDFs</li>
<li>Wi-Fi now supports up to 802.11n</li>
<li>better Enterprise support: data protection, device management, wireless app distribution, SSL VPN, multiple Exchange accounts, support for Exchange 2010</li>
<li>iPhone OS 4 now called <strong>iOS4</strong>, launches June 21st. Big feature: multitasking &#8220;done right.&#8221; Notable: unified inbox with message threading</li>
<li><strong>FaceTime</strong> &#8211; &#8220;open&#8221; standard video chat for iPhone, with zero config necessary for iPhone 4 to iPhone 4 calls. <strong>Only on Wi-Fi at the moment</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The hardware looks rather spiffy for the most part &mdash; great display, dual cameras, faster processor, better battery life&#8230; sounds like what dreams are made of. But I don&#8217;t think I can stand being with AT&#038;T for another year. I had <strong>107 <a href="http://www.keenerliving.com/why-im-not-getting-an-anroid-phone-yet" title="Why I'm Not Getting an Android Phone Yet - KeenerLiving">dropped calls</a> in the last 270</strong> days with AT&#038;T. Considering I don&#8217;t talk on the phone <em>every</em> day, that effectively means I have dealt with a dropped call once per call session. </p>
<p><strong>WTF!</strong>  </p>
<p>I have only been okay with AT&#038;T for the last year with my <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/review-att-3g-microcell" title="Review: AT&#038;T 3G MicroCell">MicroCell</a> but now that I have moved to San Francisco and explored it I just can&#8217;t stay on this network any longer. AT&#038;T service especially sucks in San Francisco. Even times when I do have a few bars, it is deathly slow. </p>
<p><a href="http://colinake.tumblr.com/post/674332982/damnit-apple" title="Damnit Apple">Colin Ake&#8217;s post</a> summarized most of my thoughts on the iPhone 4 announcement: </p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, iPhone 4 looks nice. Nice screen, dual cameras, HD video, I get it. [...] And you didn’t even throw us the bone of getting rid of AT&#038;T or upgrading to LTE.<br/><br />
And it’s not like there are better options. Sure, I could go with the EVO 4G. Then I’d have fast connectivity, right?! Right! Unless you’re in a building! I mean, seriously, go look at the Clear reviews and see how sporadic it is and how much it sucks. [...]<br/><br />
So here’s the recap. There’s a huge market for a phone that does all that, is on a platform that’ll upgrade easily and have a seamless UI and uses a real network like Verizon.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<p>Do I think the iPhone 4 is sexy? <strong>Absolutely yes</strong>. It has so many things going for it but AT&#038;T&#8217;s shoddy network is holding it back. There are blocks in my neighborhood where I get absolutely no service at all and it&#8217;s not like there are tall buildings surrounding me like in the Financial District, where horrible service is at least somewhat justifiable. How am I supposed to partake in all of the cool features of the iPhone 4 when I don&#8217;t have access to the Internet when I&#8217;m out and about? This is a <em>mobile</em> phone &mdash; requiring me to stay within earshot of my MicroCell or a Wi-Fi access point is like selling me a ball and chain (or if you prefer this metaphor: a supercar with a high-compression engine that requires 110 Octane gas when I can only find 91 Octane here in California, aside from being trackside at Infineon).</p>
<p><strong>So what phone will I end up with?</strong> I&#8217;m not sure if I want the EVO 4G, but I know my next device will be Android-based. I think I&#8217;ll wait until the next big Android hyperphone gets announced later this summer and then I&#8217;m off to Verizon or Sprint. Oh and I almost forgot why I love Android so much &mdash; native <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/first-impressions-google-voice" title="First Impressions: Google Voice on PaulStamatiou.com">Google Voice</a> integration. This is a really, really big deal for me.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts? Will you be pre-ordering your iPhone 4 on June 15th and waiting hours for it on launch day? Will you pick one at your leisure later this summer, or at all? What is your current phone and provider?</strong></p>
<p>Unrelated: on the upshot, I think the <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html" title="Apple Safari 5 What's New">Reader feature in Safari 5</a> is fantastic. Granted Chrome has been my primary browser for several months now, I might end up doing my reading within the confines of Safari 5. I&#8217;m also curious to see what happens with Safari Extensions. <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/06/coda-notes-previe/" title="Coda Notes Preview Safari Extension">Panic showed off how easy</a> it was for them to add a new feature to Safari with their extension.</p>

<p><span id="more-7045"></span>This post will sort out my likes and dislikes about the phone rather <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/19/htc-evo-4g-review/" title="HTC EVO 4G Review">than serve a full review</a>. If you don&#8217;t have time to read this entire post, here&#8217;s a summary: huge phone with subpar battery life and a great camera.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/htc_sprint_evo_4g_1200.jpg" title="Sprint HTC EVO 4G Android phone"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/htc_sprint_evo_4g.jpg" alt="Sprint HTC EVO 4G Android phone"/></a><br/><small>Huge screen and small bezels are usually the recipe for a slick product but I miss a bit of bezel useful for holding onto while taking pictures. I would often accidentally hit the button while trying to take a picture.</small></div>
<ul>
<li>4.3-inch TFT LCD WVGA (480&#215;800) display is great for consuming media and superb for the Google Maps Navigation app. Also, big screen = big keyboard = easier to type on.</li>
<li>Sprint Mobile Hotspot app (Android 2.2 includes similar hotspot functionality)</li>
<li>Kickstand!</li>
<li>Dual cameras: 8-megapixel autofocus rear camera with dual LEDs for flash, and a front facing 1.3-megapixel camera great for Qik and Skype (via Fring currently). Rear camera shoots 720p HD video.</li>
<li>Sprint network much better than AT&#038;T, at least in San Francisco.</li>
<li>Plays Flash! (barely.. should get better in Android 2.2)</li>
<li>FM Radio</li>
<li>1GHz processor makes things snappy. Every Android user I&#8217;ve shown the phone to said it felt much faster than whatever Android phone they had. Froyo should make things even faster.</li>
<li>Google Voice integration (this is a general Android feature but a huge selling point for me)</li>
</ul>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/evo_4g_back_mbp_1200.jpg" title="Back of HTC EVO 4G"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/evo_4g_back_mbp.jpg" alt="Back of HTC EVO 4G"/></a><br/><small>The rear of the EVO houses a sturdy kickstand, dual LED flash, protruding 8-megapixel autofocusing camera and speaker.</small></div>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>HTC Sense UI add-on means that Android updates must come from HTC, not immediately OTA from Google.. so you might have to wait months to receive the lightning fast Android 2.2 &#8220;Froyo&#8221; update. Nexus One owners already have Froyo.</li>
<li>Pricing issues: 4G capability invokes a mandatory $10 price premium. Mobile hotspot functionality also incurs a whopping $30/month additional fee but no data caps (yet).</li>
<li>Lackluster battery life (about 4 hours with my use &#8211; about the same as my overworked iPhone) and the rear battery cover is flimsy plastic held in place by some small clips that are sure to break soon.</li>
<li>microSD card awkwardly placed under battery. Not that you need to take it out too often or anything. Just plug microUSB cable into EVO and tell Android to use in disk mode.</li>
<li>Camera lens protrudes from the EVO&#8217;s body such that resting it on a flat surface causes the metal rim of the lens to make contact.</li>
<li>Power button is almost flush with the body and not very ergonomic. Could be easier to push.</li>
<li>Android apps are nothing like iPhone apps. Most are crap. One of the most popular apps is a task killer application to keep things running smooth, or at least that&#8217;s the claim. I have noticed the phone get slow to a crawl at times unless I keep an eye on how many apps are open, despite Android&#8217;s stellar memory management.</li>

<h4>Camera</h4>
<p>While the 4G WiMAX is what Sprint and HTC are promoting the heck out of with the EVO, that means little to me in San Francisco where a 4G network isn&#8217;t slated to emerge for about a year. The next most impressive hardware feature in that case is the camera. I place a lot of importance on my cell phone&#8217;s camera. My iPhone currently has <strong>over 5,000 iPhone-taken photos</strong> on it. The iPhone is not happy with that situation and is very slow. It&#8217;s not meant to be used for anything more casual use.  The EVO&#8217;s camera is by far <strong>the best phone camera I have ever used</strong>. Best &#8220;phone camera&#8221;&#8230; what does that mean? It means that the pictures look good enough up to around 1600px wide. After that you can see some compression artifacts and grain. For the most part, given sufficient lighting conditions you can leave your Point &#038; Shoot camera at home and have good enough pictures to throw up on Facebook. Of course, there&#8217;s no real physical zoom with the EVO so zooming in will just look pixelated.</p>

<p>The flash is very bright, so much so that it will wash out people/subjects in close proximity. Autofocus has a harder time in low lighting so you have to be patient while it focuses. For the most part the camera interface is slick and snapping pictures is lighting quick compared to the iPhone with the exception of autofocusing. The front-facing 1.3MP camera is nothing to write home about but affords users the ability to <em>finally</em> do video chat. I tested it out on a 15-minute video chat on Skype via Fring and it worked quite well. Though my mother did mention there was a slight video delay (I was on my WiFi network).</p>

<h4>Verdict</h4>
<p>I went to Best Buy today (EVO launch day) and waited in a long line for about 15 minutes before leaving the store without buying anything. I didn&#8217;t want the phone <em>that</em> bad. To get an everyday-usable phone setup I would need to get a case to protect the protruding lens, external battery pack so that it would last more than 4 hours and a handful of micro-USB cables to keep around the apartment, with my laptop, in my bag with an extra charger and so on. That would start to get pricey.</p>
<p>Even more so, I really wanted the mobile hotspot feature without paying the $30/month premium. That is available in Android 2.2 which I could get on the EVO with a few hours spent <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5554698/put-android-22-froyo-on-your-sprint-htc-evo-with-root-access" title="put-android-22-froyo-on-your-sprint-htc-evo-with-root-access">rooting it and installing a Sense-less Froyo</a>, or with some other Android phone. The cheapest EVO 4G plan with mobile hotspot is $109/month &mdash; rather high. My iPhone bill is currently ~$90/month due to add-on $15 text messaging.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m going to wait. Wait to see what Steve Jobs announces on Monday. Regardless of how paradigm shifting the rumored iPhone 4G is I do not see myself purchasing it if it is still tied to AT&#038;T. Dual cameras. Neat. 960&#215;640 IPS HD display. Great. AT&#038;T. Fail.</p>
<p>This was a rather quick review and I left a lot of information out. Let me know if you have any questions about the phone or Android in general in the comments and I&#8217;ll reply!</p>

While their (dv) Dedicated-Virtual VPS offerings allowed users to have root access and the ability to modify much of the installed software, it was still a fairly turnkey solution: create a new account, transfer files/databases over and everything is ready to go. It also ran Parallels Plesk control panel which sys admins and developers unanimously seem to despise for a mixture of Plesk being a resource hog as well as only working well for out-of-the-box configurations and becoming a burden with custom setups &mdash; say, a Rails app. There is a large market for tech-savvy folks that prefer to handle all aspects of server setup and administration themselves. Enter the (ve) Virtual Environment.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/mediatemple_ve_banner.jpg" alt="Media Temple (ve) Virtual Environment Server" title="Media Temple (ve) Virtual Environment Server"/></div>
<blockquote><p>A new product series has been created, ProDev, which caters to the side of our customer base that wishes to take hosting a step further. These users want more controls and low-level options. Therefore, we’re working on new ProDev products, such as an API, CDN and Advanced DNS, that compliment (ve) Server.<br/>&mdash;&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/2010/05/05/ve-server-is-here/" title="(ve) Server is Here!">(mt)</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>You know who these people are &mdash; they typically congregate around Linode, Amazon EC2 and Slicehost services. They know exactly what OS and solution stack they want to use, their favorite kernel version and so on. <span id="more-7043"></span> After having a <a href="http://weblog.mediatemple.net/weblog/category/system-incidents/1026-gs-security-advisory/" title="Media Temple gs server security advisory">more than a few issues</a> with their (gs) Grid-Server, Media Temple needs for this latest (ve) offering to catch on. Here&#8217;s why I think it will.</p>
<p class="alert"><strong>Full Disclosure:</strong> I have been exclusively hosted with Media Temple for almost 5 years now and have a partnership with them. They often hook me up with free food whenever I&#8217;m in Culver City or at one of their events at SXSW.</p>
<h4>(ve) Basics</h4>
<blockquote><p>(ve) Server is designed for users who have significant experience with Linux, or for those who are interested in learning. Our goal is to give customers complete control of their Virtual Environment, therefore servers are delivered with SSH only. You will control and install all software.</p></blockquote>
<p>In regards to hardware, the (ve) is far from commodity hardware with SAS disks in RAID 10 but I digress; if you want to read more about specs <a href="http://mediatemple.net/webhosting/ve/" title="Media Temple (ve) Server">visit their site</a>. Media Temple lets you install Ubuntu LTS, Ubuntu, Fedora release 12, Debian and CentOS distributions on (ve) servers. After choosing what OS you want installed on the server and waiting about 10 minutes to have it provisioned, you get to SSH into a basic Linux installation. <strong>Nothing is pre-installed</strong>. This gives you the freedom (or burden, if you are relatively new to Linux and systems administration) to setup everything on your own. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/pstam_ve_mt_manage.jpg" alt="Media Temple (ve) Server" title="Media Temple (ve) Server"/></div>
<p>Now you get the point of the (ve) server &mdash; you run the show and know your way around Linux for the most part. Media Temple has <a href="http://wiki.mediatemple.net/index.php/Category:(ve)" title="Media Temple community wiki">several guides online</a> that help with basic setup. For those considering such a developer-friendly VPS option, be warned that <strong>a solid setup is at least a few hours away</strong> of installing packages, configuring files, transferring files, importing databases, configuring more files, securing everything, monitoring for a while and tweaking for optimal performance.</p>
<p>As far as pricing is concerned, the (ve) is priced competitively. Below is simple comparison on the pricing of the closest offering to a 1GB RAM VPS:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/vps_pricing_ve_slicehost_linode.jpg" alt="VPS pricing comparison: Linode, Slicehost, Media Temple" title="VPS pricing comparison: Linode, Slicehost, Media Temple"/><br/><small>Linode, Slicehost, Media Temple</small></div>
<p>Media Temple&#8217;s logic is that they can afford to price the (ve) as such since advanced users (the target market) are much less likely to require technical support.</p>
<h4>My Setup &amp; Experience so far</h4>
<p>This blog has been hosted on a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/media-temple-beefs-up-dv-to-35" title="MediaTemple (dv) 3.5 server">(dv) 3.5</a> with 2GB of RAM (though I think you temporarily get access to 3GB of RAM for under high load) for over 2 years now. That setup started getting finicky and needed daily or sometimes twice daily Apache restarts or it would crash on its own. Needless to say, it was time to start from scratch with a clean setup &mdash; much like how I tend to completely reinstall OS X every year or so (or back in my Windows XP days, every 6-9 months).</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/mediatemple_pstam_ve_accountcenter.jpg" alt="Media Temple (ve) server in Account Center" title="Media Temple (ve) server in Account Center" width="620" height="381"/><br/><small>(ve) Control Panel in the Media Temple Account Center</small></div>
<p>I was not much of a CentOS fan on the (dv) server, so I chose to setup my (ve) with Ubuntu. Once the (ve) server was added to my Media Temple account, I enabled root SSH access and SSH&#8217;d in, with my first objective being creating a new user, adding that user to the sudoers file and configuring SSH to disallow root SSH login. This will probably sound familiar to you if you have tinkered with a fresh Linux server install before. If not, several of Media Temple&#8217;s guides will come in handy but for the most part <code style="display:inline;">apt-get</code> is your friend.</p>
<ul>

<li>and so on..</li>
</ul>
<p>A while later I had a simple LAMP setup with Webmin (lightweight control panel) configured on my (ve) server. I temporarily changed an <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-bulletproof-server-backups-with-amazon-s3" title="How To: Bulletproof Server Backups with Amazon S3">Amazon S3 blog backup</a> to public, downloaded it on the (ve), uncompressed the files into the public web folder then imported a recent database dump with <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/" title="Sequel Pro &mdash; MySQL database management app for Mac OS X">Sequel Pro</a>. The last step was logging into the Account Center and changing the zone file to point to the new server. I had set the TTL low so the DNS propagated quickly and the new server was live within minutes.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/mediatemple_pstam_ve_server.jpg" alt="Media Temple (ve) Server Guide in Account Center" title="Media Temple (ve) Server Guide in Account Center" width="620" height="381"/><br/><small>(ve) Server Guide</small></div>
<p>Then I got in touch with <a href="http://chrislea.com/" title="Chris Lea">Chris Lea</a> at Media Temple who looked over my setup and offered a few suggestions and made some adjustments. Notably he installed and configured <strong>nginx as a reverse proxy</strong> to serve static files &mdash; images, javascript,  CSS, HTML, XML, et cetera &mdash; while letting Apache handle the dynamic stuff. I prefer this setup over a wholly nginx configuration so that all my <code style="display:inline;">.htaccess</code> rewrite rules would remain in place (and not need to be rewritten for nginx) and so that various WordPress plugins that need their own rewrite rules would not break when they needed to tweak those settings. Also, since I use a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/" title="WP Super Cache WordPress plugin">caching plugin</a> that creates static HTML cache files, nginx will end up serving most pages, leaving resource-hogging Apache with little to do. The best of both worlds in my opinion. </p>
<p>Chris also installed APC for PHP, set expires headers for all image types to 1 day and enabled compression for text based file types (I <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-optimize-your-apache-site-with-mod-deflate" title="How To: Optimize your Apache Site with Mod Deflate">wrote about compression for Apache</a> a while ago). And finally, <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/" title="Munin networked resource monitoring">munin</a> was installed for resource monitoring.</p>
<p>All said and done, the server is now using around 400MB of RAM most of the time. Compare that to using at least 2GB of RAM at idle with my last (unstable) server setup and I&#8217;m rather delighted. Other performance options I had considered were <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/" title="Squid cache - http://www.squid-cache.org/" title="Squid caching proxy - optimizing web delivery">Squid</a> (but was told nginx is better for a reverse proxy role) and <a href="http://varnish-cache.org/" title="Varnish cache and HTTP accelerator">Varnish</a>. Of course, this blog does not receive anywhere near the amount of traffic to <em>need</em> those kinds of advanced setups.</p>
<p>While the (ve) box does not come with a hefty, resource-intense control panel like Plesk included on (dv) servers, it does come with <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/virtuozzo/tools/vzpp/" title="Parallels Power Panels (PPP)">Parallels Power Panel</a> that provides basic monitoring and service controls. </p>

<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<p>So that&#8217;s a little background info on my current server setup and working with the relatively new (ve) VPS. No complaints to report of thus far and it was exactly what I was looking for: a no frills, simple server that lets me do everything myself. While I was in the end working with a typical LAMP setup (albeit with some nginx mixed in there), the (ve) and related offerings from competitors are aimed at customization and the ability to adapt the server to fit any need from Python projects with Django all the way to using Yaws to serve up Erlang apps.</p>
<p><strong>Would you be in the market for a developer inspired VPS that requires you to do all the heavy lifting at the benefit of extreme customization? Who is your current webhosting provider and what kind of hosting needs do you have? What framework/software/stack does your server run?</strong></p>

<h4>Apartment Hunting</h4>
<p>I first scheduled a weeklong trip to San Francisco to get more oriented with the city and find out what neighborhoods I liked. I told myself I would not depart until I had signed a lease and received the keys to my new apartment. I had planned <span id="more-6926"></span>on couch surfing at several friends&#8217; apartments but <a href="http://okdork.com" title="Noah Kagan's OkDork">Noah Kagan</a> (with whom I had worked on some Mint.com marketing years ago) of the not quite launched <a href="http://appsumo.com" title="Get great deals on your favorite websites - AppSumo">AppSumo</a> was gracious enough to let me stay on his couch for the entire week. Once I got settled in on Noah&#8217;s couch I spent several hours each day <strong>browsing two great apartment listing mashups &mdash; <a href="http://padmapper.com" title="Padmapper" alt="Padmapper">PadMapper</a> and <a href="http://hotpads.com" title="Hotpads" alt="Hotpads">HotPads</a></strong>.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/padmapper_crop.jpg" title="Padmapper" alt="Padmapper"/></div>
<p>My first objective was to get a sense for <strong>what neighborhood I wanted to live in</strong>. A bunch of Googling, walking around and talking with friends helped me figure that out. <strong>The <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/neighborhoods/sf/" title="San Francisco Neighborhoods - SF Gate">SF Gate has a great section explaining neighborhoods</a></strong>, their restaurants, attractions and so on. I <strong>narrowed down my search</strong> to Hayes Valley, Duboce Triangle and the Mission. For example, here&#8217;s a snippet of what SF Gate says about the Mission:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Internet boom brought on heavy gentrification &#8212; trendy restaurants and boutiques blazed in, rents shot up and many Latinos and artists were displaced by the influx of highly paid young professionals. Today, there&#8217;s an interesting mix of places that survived the changes and new arrivals that are trying to make the Mission home. [...] Generally speaking, the 24th Street area is the culturally rich heart of the Mission, the stretch from Dolores Street through to Valencia Street is young and upscale, the area around 16th and Valencia streets hops with nightlife and the industrial area near Bryant Street has some hip, trendy restaurants.</p></blockquote>
<p>It did not take long before I needed to <strong>adjust my expectations</strong> to fit within my budget. I was expecting to land a 600-700 square foot 1-bedroom apartment in a decent neighborhood for around $1,200. Yeah, that was <em>not</em> going to happen. In Atlanta I leased a 723 square foot 1-bedroom loft for $975/month in a favorable part of town with included parking, in-unit washer and dryer, microwave, garbage disposal, central heat and air conditioning and a dishwasher. The same in San Francisco would cost around $1,800-2,200/month and very likely not include several of those amenities. My priorities changed and <strong>I focused instead on finding a 400-500 square foot studio</strong> with in-building laundry. That was going to be enough of a challenge.</p>
<p>The first few days were hectic to say the least. I would browse for a while, find something decent, then call to ask questions only to be let down every single time. One particular place seemed to fit the bill then I called to find out it was under 300 square feet. Another place seemed great online and in the pictures then I started walking in the neighborhood and quickly realized it was not an area I wanted to live in (16th &#038; Mission &#8211; near the BART station). This happened a few more times. It then became a game of catching new listings as they were posted; so I was online a lot that week. If I wasn&#8217;t restricted to my short timeframe (I had to move before my lease was up in Atlanta), the best solution would be to setup a script to notify me of new listings that matched my preferences. That&#8217;s exactly what <a href="http://twitter.com/nickbushak" title="Nick Bushak">Nick Bushak</a> did for a private Google group of hackers that were trying to find a summer &#8220;Hacker House.&#8221; I was initially looking to live with them but the timing did not work out.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sfhousing10.jpg" title="Script searching craigslist for apartments" alt="Script searching craigslist for apartments"><br/><small>Having something or someone else search for you is probably one of the better ways to deal with long-term apartment hunting. For example, Noah outsourced his apartment search to an overseas assistant for $4/hour that found listings according to his preferences, made viewing appointments and added them to his calendar.</small></div>
<p>On the fourth day of apartment hunting I <strong>stumbled upon a great listing within hours of its posting</strong>. It was a studio in the Mission District with a secured parking garage (for extra of course), newer construction (likely 1970s &mdash; much better than the 1920s buildings I had seen in most listings), RFID entry and in-building laundry facilities. I went on Twitter to ask my friends what they thought of the exact area and all seemed to like it.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/pstam_studio_listing.jpg" alt="Studio listing san francisco" title="Studio listing san francisco"/><br/><small>Listing photos are incredibly deceiving&#8230; this lamp was not included with the apartment.</small></div>
<p>I scheduled a viewing appointment for the same day, in between two other apartment viewings I had booked earlier. I got to the neighborhood an hour early, walked around and stopped by a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/four-barrel-coffee-san-francisco" rel="nofollow" title="Four Barrel Coffee">coffee shop with lots of character</a> that <a href="http://venturehacks.com/" title="VentureHacks">Nivi</a> recommended. I sat down and <strong>chatted with some of the locals</strong> to see what they thought of the area and what it was like at night. It turned out I had been chatting with someone that graduated from UGA (my alma mater&#8217;s rival). Then I went to the apartment viewing and was pleased to hear the leasing agent say I was the first person to view the apartment. She also mentioned <strong>many Google employees live in the building</strong> since their shuttle picks up nearby. The kitchen was smaller than I had hoped for &mdash; actually the entire place was smaller than I had in mind (probably 375-400 square feet at best) &mdash; and the oven was tiny (I cook a lot), but I was going to deal with it. I filled out the paperwork that day. </p>

I will be keeping an eye out for deadpooled startups that sell their Herman Millers for cheap.</small></div>
<p>The mechanics of actually getting them to approve me for the apartment requires some explaining. Landlords and leasing agents in San Francisco are rather aggressive. Many apartments have open house viewings often. I had heard of some nightmare situations when it came to these open houses; that everyone would have their checkbooks out, proof of income, pay stubs, credit reports printed out and were ready to sign the lease right there. I was particularly nervous about the whole situation as <strong>I was unemployed when looking for an apartment</strong> and had no verifiable income that I could list. The only thing I had in my favor was a good <strong>credit score</strong> from the three credit bureaus. I was able to find this out easily with American Express CreditSecure credit report monitoring ($2 for the first month, then cancel immediately). The <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/freereports">FTC lists authorized, free ways</a> to acquire your credit report but I am not sure whether their recommended service can get the report the same day. Some apartment listings state they will <strong>waive the application fee</strong> if you come to the viewing with a recent credit report in hand. </p>
<p>I got a call back from the leasing agent saying that the landlord <strong>gave me two options</strong>: I could get a cosigner or since I had a good credit score they would let me sign the lease if I provided two months rent (2x security deposit) in addition to the first month&#8217;s prorated rent. I chose the latter option as it would be quicker and help my credit score in the long-run. That meant I had get a hefty cashier&#8217;s check made before I got the keys to the apartment. </p>
<p>In no particular order, here are some <strong>random apartment things</strong> I learned during my hunt and lease signing process:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>don&#8217;t need air conditioning</strong> in San Francisco. It&#8217;s mid-May and I have my heater on right now. Though I did purchase a small Vornado fan (&#8220;air circulator&#8221;) for the few summer days that it does reach 80 degrees in the city.</li>
<li>In-unit washer and dryer is just about impossible to find. Same with dishwasher. If you find an in-<em>building</em> washer and dryer, you&#8217;re sitting pretty.</li>
<li>Just about everything is early 1900s construction and has hardwood floors. In fact many listings love pointing out period details, stating Edwardian this or Victorian that.</li>
<li>Many apartments with hardwood floor state in the lease that tenants <strong>must cover 80% of the floor with carpet</strong> to alleviate noise issues for neighbors. To give you an idea, a 6&#8242; by 10&#8242; carpet from Ikea costs $199 and you would need two to make it <em>look like</em> 80% of the floor was covered. Keep that in mind. Of course there are definitely cheaper places to buy carpet.</li>
<li>You get two pamphlets when you sign your lease: how to deal with lead-based paint and how to survive natural disasters like fires and earthquakes.</li>
<li>While getting renter&#8217;s insurance you will be asked if you want to buy earthquake insurance (doubles the price). The local Best Buy sells &#8220;Quake Straps&#8221; to fasten your TV to the wall.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s important to ask the leasing agent if previous tenants have (successfully) had DSL/Cable installed prior. Buildings built in the early 1900&#8242;s don&#8217;t have the best wiring and that may affect signal quality and thus performance.</li>
<li>There is an ISP called <a href="http://web-pass.com/" title="Webpass ISP">Web-Pass</a> that offers FTTH for certain properties. Check to see if those properties have any apartment listings because the service is great: 45 or 100 megabit. Otherwise Comcast offers up to 50 megabits down with their &#8220;Extreme 50&#8243; plan &mdash; if the 250GB/month bandwidth cap does not bother you.</li>
<li>It takes Comcast at least a week to come for an installation appointment. If you&#8217;re lucky one of your friends will have a Sprint Overdrive or Verizon MiFi you can borrow.</li>
<li>Buying a bed? Most places deliver same day for free (but it&#8217;s implied you tip them). I got my queen, box spring and frame from a place called Sleep Train.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obvious Pro Tip:</strong> Save up before heading out to San Francisco while unemployed. If you plan on living by yourself, I would say at least $5,000-7,500 would be a decent number to have in mind if you can live somewhat frugally. Otherwise, and especially if you are moving cross-country, $8,000+ would be best. Friends that have moved to San Francisco through work received ~$10k relocation bonuses, so that&#8217;s what their companies value the move at. Please leave a comment below if you have thoughts on this. </p>

<p>I spent some time deciding how I wanted to move. Should I rent a U-Haul truck and car trailer to drive out? Or should I rent the U-Haul and have my car shipped out? Or maybe I should have my stuff sent out in a shipping crate while I drive out  or perhaps I just leave the car at home and fly out? <strong>Eventually I went back to one of my favorite Paul Graham essays, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html" title="Paul Graham on Stuff">Stuff</a>, and read it again. I took that to heart and sold or donated as much of my stuff as I could with ease.</strong></p>

<p> Surprisingly, I sold almost everything through Twitter and Tumblr. This made sense financially as well &mdash; a shipping container would have cost $1,600 for port to port delivery which requires renting a truck to load and unload, or $2,400 for door to door delivery. Another alternative would have been shipping some boxes on a pallet. I believe that runs in the $400-$600 range.</p>
<p><strong>A few small boxes, a suitcase and my laptop remained.</strong> And my <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/review-att-3g-microcell" title="Review: AT&#038;T 3G MicroCell">AT&#038;T 3G MicroCell</a> because their network sucks everywhere I go and at the very least I want good signal at home. If you are in the same boat, I highly recommend you consider the MicroCell. Aside from a few dropped calls when my iPhone switches between the MicroCell and a regular cell tower, I am very happy with the MicroCell. </p>

<h4>The City</h4>
<p>The first thing I wanted to learn about San Francisco was <strong>getting around with public transportation</strong>. Coming from Atlanta, which is definitely a car city, I had lots of catching up to do. For those unfamiliar with transportation in the bay area, there are quite a few options: Caltrain, BART, Muni, AC transit, VTA light rail (south bay) in addition to taxis, ZipCar and City CarShare. If you take public transit with any regularity you will probably want to get a <strong><a href="http://translink.org" title="TransLink">TransLink card</a></strong> (soon to be renamed Clipper). Otherwise keep some crisp dollar bills on hand at all times for Muni. There&#8217;s nothing worse than holding up a line of people trying to get on the bus while you try to cram in two crumpled dollars into the machine.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sanfran_translinks.jpg" title="BART, MUNI, Zipcar, TransLink - transportation in San Francisco" alt="BART, MUNI, Zipcar, Translink - transportation in San Francisco"/><br/><small>Left to Right: monthly Muni pass ($60. getting phased out by TransLink), BART pass (TransLink can also do this), TransLink card, ZipCard.</small></div>
<p>Other things I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last Caltrain out of San Francisco leaves at midnight. Muni runs 24 hours. BART stops running at midnight and resumes 4am on weekdays, 6am on Saturdays and 8am on Sundays.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s always chilly</strong>. I have yet to get a chance to wear shorts. I went to Union Square and got some more jeans the first week. I will probably need to get another windbreaker. <a href="http://www.gaborcselle.com/" title="Gabor hits Send - a blog about email and startups">Gabor</a> told me he quickly learned that everyone out here wears button-up shirts when going out, so he had to beef up his wardrobe in that regard.</li>
<li>It takes about 30 minutes to get to downtown from the Mission on Muni (only 2-3 miles). On BART or underground Muni rail it&#8217;s more like 10 minutes.</li>
<li>The most I&#8217;ve had to pay to get across town (well, almost across town: Mission to North Beach) via taxi was $15. Mission to downtown is about $8 (not including tip). (First 1/5th mile is $3.10 with every additional 1/5th mile or minute adding 45 cents.)</li>
<li>Yellow and Luxor cabs accept credit/debit cards.</li>
<li>Keep an eye out for some parts of Market Street that have taxi/bus-only left lanes.</li>
<li>Driving in San Francisco takes some getting used to because the traffic lights are usually on the sides, not hanging above the intersections.</li>
<li>Finding a cab in SoMa once a Giants game lets out is rather difficult.</li>
<li>iPhone Google Maps has excellent public transit information but can drastically tell you different routes just to get you on a bus/train sooner, even if the trip might be longer. Tinker with changing your departure time. Alternatively there are many <strong>iPhone apps for transportation info</strong>: Taxi Magic, MyCaltrain, iCommute SF, Pocket Muni, iBart Live. NextMuni.com is also useful.</li>
<li>Do not fall asleep on BART or you will miss the Embarcadero stop and end up in Oakland. I speak from experience and a series of entertaining tweets.</li>
<li>Two Ikeas: Emeryville just across the Bay Bridge and in East Palo Alto</li>
<li>There is a Pinkberry near Stanford campus. Fraiche Yogurt in Palo Alto is great too &mdash; Steve Jobs has been spotted there before. Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDEMSOdy-_M" title="Scoble interview of Fraiche yogurt">the Scoble interview</a>.</li>
<li>Tea tasting is the thing to do in Chinatown. Also, Ten Ren at 949 Grant Ave is a great place for $3 tapioca bubble tea.</li>
<li>Blue Bottle Coffee is popular here. Visiting Blue Bottle Cafe at 66 Mint St is a must.</li>
<li>People here were not joking around; <strong>AT&#038;T is <em>horrible</em> in San Francisco</strong>. In particular I have noticed many dead spots around the Mission.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In Short:</strong> For someone coming from Atlanta, SF Public transportation is great. I brought a car out here and now I&#8217;m already thinking about getting rid of it. Related: parallel parking on a steep hill with a manual transmission is annoying.</p>
<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<p>I have now been in San Francisco for exactly two weeks and I am in love with the city. Hopefully this honeymoon period does not fizzle away too soon. </p>
<p><strong>Any questions? Have any of you made a cross-country or other such long-distance move before? Reading this and live in San Francisco? Let&#8217;s meetup some time.</strong></p>

After selling the Rokits I began considering headphones as a replacement for my audio consuming needs. Investing in high quality headphones started to make sense for a few reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li><strong>1)</strong> I will likely have roommates at some point during my life in San Francisco and I can&#8217;t blast music all day and night</li>
<li><strong>2)</strong> My roommates might blast music all day and night so I will need some good noise canceling headphones to concentrate while I work</li>
<li><strong>3)</strong> Headphones will easily fit in my <a title="Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 laptop messenger bag" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Timbuk2_Commute_2_Laptop_Messenger_Bag">Timbuk2 Commute 2.0 bag</a> along with my <a title="How To: Apple MacBook Pro RAID 0 array with 2 Intel X25-M SSDs" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-apple-macbook-pro-raid-0-array-with-2-intel-x25-m-ssds">trusty 17-inch MacBook Pro</a> for various Caltrain trips to South Bay</li>
</ul>
<p>After I decided to look into high quality headphones I became reacquainted with the Beats. While I had <span id="more-6876"></span>been aware of them since their 2008 Consumer Electronics Show debut, I never gave them a real look solely due to the Monster Cable association. I assumed the overpriced Beats were junk, as is the case with most Monster products (my lawyer tells me it&#8217;s not libel if it&#8217;s true). The headphones are the product of a collaboration between revered rapper, actor and producer <a title="Dr. Dre on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre">Dr. Dre</a> and Monster Cable. Monster positioned the Beats Studio headphones as their flagship personal audio product with an MSRP of $349.95 USD.</p>
<p>Monster also has a cheaper offering called the Beats Solo; they are smaller and lightweight but lack noise canceling functionality. The Beats Solo (MSRP $199.95 USD) are — according to a Monster representative on their Facebook page — geared towards bass while the Beats Studio were designed for all-around flat response. I would have thought it was the other way around with the powered Beats Studio being meant for bass. I say this because the Beats Studio have excellent bass, which I will discuss in the performance section of this review. The only Monster headphones product priced above the Beats Studio is a DJ-oriented pair, called Beats Spin, slated for a June 2010 release.</p>

<small>Beats Studio circumaural (also known as full-size) headphones as modeled by yours truly.</small></div>
<p>Let me start this review off by making it clear that <strong>I am an extreme critic of all things Monster Cable</strong> and feel they only sell over-marketed and overpriced crap aimed at taking advantage of not-quite-tech-savvy consumers unaware of facts like how <a title="overpriced HDMI cables" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mint.com/blog/trends/the-rip1/">HDMI is a digital signal</a> and there is no difference in signal and thus video quality between a $10 <a title="Monoprice cables" href="http://monoprice.com">Monoprice</a> cable and a $250 Monster cable.</p>
<h4>Unboxing and Setup</h4>
<div class="center"><a title="Beats Studio Headphones Unboxed" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_unboxed_1200.jpg"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_unboxed.jpg" alt="Beats Studio Headphones Unboxed" /></a><br />
<small>The Beats Studio unboxed. They come with a touring case they fold nicely into.</small></div>
<p>The Beats Studio box was a little larger and heavier than I expected. The box sleeve slides off to uncover a nice unfolding box displaying the Beats already folded inside of their own cheap carrying case. Glancing at the other side of the box reveals cables, adapters, batteries and promotional material. There are two adapters provided — one for converting the 3.5mm mini-jack to a 1/4-inch TRS connector as well as a dual-prong airplane audio adapter. Two male-to-male mini-jack cables (a red and black one) are included; both 4.26 feet (1.3m) long. The Beats Studio headphones do not have any audio cables permanently attached and have a female mini-jack port built-in — a <strong>very handy feature for a number of reasons</strong>. I like that I am not tied down to using the provided cables. If I wanted a different length or style of cable, such as a coiled cable, or if I just need to replace a damaged cable, I do not have to replace the headphones too. That being said, I think <strong>the included cables are the perfect length</strong>. Some people have complained that they are too short but they are perfect for my typical use — using them with my MacBook Pro on my desk or lap as well as using them with my iPhone in my pocket.</p>
<div class="center"><a title="Beats Studio Headphones plugged into MacBook Pro" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_mbp_1200.jpg"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_mbp.jpg" alt="Beats Studio Headphones plugged into MacBook Pro" /></a><br />
<small>One small nitpick &#8211; I would have liked a right angle connector for when using the Beats on a laptop. For example on a plane or when computing on your lap it is annoying to have cables sticking straight out.</small></div>
<p>The black cable, dubbed the iSoniTalk cable for its handy compatibility with iPhones, includes an inline microphone and button. When connected to my MacBook Pro the button on the iSoniTalk cable can pause/play iTunes music and when connected to my iPhone can do the same as well as accept incoming calls and end them. It&#8217;s regrettable that using the Beats Studio as a headset does not workout well; it&#8217;s hard to hear yourself talk and the microphone is placed a little too far back to get clear sound without holding it closer to your mouth.</p>
<div class="center"><a title="Beats Studio Headphones with Monster iSoniTalk cable and iPhone" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_iphone_1200.jpg"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_iphone.jpg" alt="Beats Studio Headphones with Monster iSoniTalk cable and iPhone" /></a><br />

<p>Those unfamiliar with the Beats Studio will be taken aback by the <strong>included batteries</strong>. Why do headphones need batteries? Well the Beats Studio use the batteries for <strong>both amplification purposes and to power the integrated noise canceling circuitry</strong>. More on how this all works later on. Installing the batteries was a trivial process that required unscrewing a panel on the left ear cup. The right ear cup houses the power switch and indicator LED.</p>
<div class="center"><a title="2 AAA batteries for Beats headphones" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_batteries_1200.jpg"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_batteries.jpg" alt="2 AAA batteries for Beats headphones" /></a><br />
<small>A panel on the left ear cup unscrews to show the required 2 AAA batteries. When these die, I&#8217;ll replace them with lightweight lithiums.</small></div>
<p><strong>Unfortunately — and this is a huge downside for the Beats Studio — the headphones only work with batteries installed and the noise canceling switch flipped on</strong>. There is no passive setting devoid of noise canceling that does not need battery power. You cannot use them at all without batteries.</p>
<div class="center"><a title="Beats Studio Headphones by Dr Dre and Monster Cable" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_vfold_1200.jpg"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_vfold.jpg" alt="Beats Studio Headphones by Dr Dre and Monster Cable" /></a><br />
<small>The red LED means the Beats are on with noise canceling engaged. The LED turns orange when battery power is low.</small></div>
<p>The case is likely that the 40mm drivers used are too large to be powered without the aid of batteries. You will need to keep a drawer full of AAA batteries on hand. Okay I am exaggerating a bit, but an active user will need to replace batteries every 2 weeks with a moderate user replacing them every month. Of course, if you forget to turn off the headphones one night the batteries will need replacing much sooner. I have not owned the Beats long enough to test battery life claims but <a title="Jake Jarvis" href="http://jakejarvis.com/">Jake Jarvis</a> provided me with the aforementioned data from his own Beats Studio experience.</p>
<h4>Fit, Finish and Feel</h4>
<p>Everything about the Beats draws attention, for better or for worse. The outer facing construction is glossy plastic, which while looks nice at first I can imagine it will quickly become scratched and show regular wear and tear more so than if it had a matte finish. Monster claims the finish is scratch-resistant and I have only had the Beats for a week so I can&#8217;t comment on that yet.  One thing is for sure though, the <strong>exterior is a fingerprint magnet</strong>. That explains the included microfiber cloth.</p>
<p>The inner plastic of the headband has a matte finish that I like considerably more. Moving up the inside of the headband there are two small aluminum pieces neatly engraved with &#8220;studio&#8221; on one side and the Monster logo on the other side. The entire headphones assembly weighs in at just under 0.6 pounds. Compared to professional studio reference headphones weighing in around 0.7 pounds that are classified as mid-weight, the Beats are on the lighter side. While I personally prefer heavier headphones, the lightweight Beats Studio are ideal for travel.</p>
<p>In the event the color black is not your style, Monster also sells white and Boston Red Sox themed versions (at a $50 premium). Alternatively, you may opt to <a title="ColorWare for Beats Studio by Dr. Dre" href="http://www.colorwarepc.us/p-188-beats-studio.aspx">send in your Beats to ColorWare</a> and have them drop some candy paint all over your &#8216;phones however you like for $250.</p>
<div class="center"><a title="Beats by Dre logo" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_logo_crop_1200.jpg"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_logo_crop.jpg" alt="Beats by Dre logo" /></a><br />
<small>It&#8217;s hard to find a side of these headphones that isn&#8217;t branded or marked in some way; something that might deter potential owners.</small></div>
<p>Okay so that&#8217;s a <em>description</em> of the headphones, but <strong>how do they really </strong><em><strong>fee</strong></em><em><strong>l</strong></em>? Honestly, they seem flimsy and very plastic-y. While holding or putting them on there is a bit of a &#8220;plastic on plastic&#8221; dissonance. There are small fitment details that annoy me too. For example, the joints can extend slightly backwards past their stopping point. Another annoyance is that the ear cups freely move about and have no resistance, making for a plastic clank whenever you take off or move the headphones and the ear cups immediately drop.</p>
<div class="center"><a title="Beats Studio Headphones by Dr Dre and Monster Cable" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_wearing_dre_beats_closeup_1200.jpg"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_wearing_dre_beats_closeup.jpg" alt="Beats Studio Headphones by Dr Dre and Monster Cable" /></a><br />
<small>Sign of a cheap paint job lacking uniformity &#8211; the clearcoat/paint beads up next to edges. It should be pristine for the price Monster is asking.</small></div>

<p>Everything thus far in this section has more or less been nitpicking. <strong>What about the comfort?</strong> I can&#8217;t knock off any points there; the Beats Studio <strong>feel great</strong>. Despite the ear cups and headband being wrapped in some sort of cheap vinyl/leatherette they never became too hot and remained dry.</p>
<div class="center"><a title="Beats Studio Headphones with Apple MacBook Pro" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_glossy_1200.jpg"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_glossy.jpg" alt="Beats Studio Headphones with Apple MacBook Pro" /></a><br />
<small>Can you say glossy?</small></div>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<p>As with all quality audio devices, best testing practices include listening to uncompressed (WAV), lossless (FLAC) or high bit-rate audio (256+ kbps MP3). In addition, it would be wise to test these headphones with a quality standalone audio output device like the PreSonus AudioBox USB I used in my Rokit studio monitor setup. However, I opted to <strong>test without an external audio output device</strong> as most people reading this review wouldn&#8217;t use one; more importantly these headphones are meant to be mobile; used with iPhones and so on, but I digress. I listened to a plethora of FLAC and high bit-rate MP3 files with the equalizer off and OS volume at varying levels between 5% and 60% (<strong>Pro Tip</strong>: hold option and shift in OS X while adjusting volume to increase/decrease in tiny increments).</p>
<p>Before I dive into details, I will talk about the <strong>noise canceling</strong> feature of these headphones. Despite being called &#8220;isolation&#8221; headphones, the Beats are powered, active noise canceling headphones. This can be tested by simply turning them on and wearing them; no audio source or input cable necessary. My unscientific decibel meter (iPhone app) tests <strong>showed a max reduction of 4-5 dB</strong>. That is to say the average ambient noise level with the headphones worn but switched off was 44 dB and with them switched on it was 40 dB. I tried this in a number of scenarios with differing ambient noise levels. With the air conditioning on, the average ambient noise level was 53 dB and with the Beats Studio switched on it dropped to 48 dB. Monster claims a maximum actual noise reduction of up to -14 dB. However, it is important to note that the Beats Studio seem to do a better job at canceling out lower frequency sounds like air conditioning and refrigerator noise as well as some high frequency fluorescent lamp ballast hum than mid-range frequency sounds like people talking. <strong>Is a 4 or 5 dB reduction in noise level noticeable? </strong><strong>Definitely</strong>. I would rate the noise canceling functionality in the Beats Studio as above average. Part of the secret behind this could be that Monster placed the microphones necessary for noise canceling on the inside of the ear cups, more accurate to what your ears hear, than on the outside of the ear cups. I have yet to take these on a flight with me but I imagine they will be a welcomed traveling companion.</p>
<p><strong>Do they sound any good?</strong> While Monster claims these headphones are more about all-around flat response than being bass biased, <strong>my first impressions</strong> were along the lines of &#8221;Whoa, these things can make some <em>great</em> bass.&#8221; For the most part bass is punchy with a response that is much closer to tight than boomy. Most rap songs tend to have a continuous boomy bass line — for example &#8220;Coca Coca&#8221; on Gucci Mane&#8217;s The Burrrprint 2 HD album — and while the Beats perform well with those types of songs, the <strong>bass tends to overpower the weak </strong><strong>midtones</strong>. Examples of punchy bass are found in any track on the new Gorillaz album, Plastic Beach. That is the type of music that shows where the Beats excel, without any overpowering bass. Treble with the Beats Studio is clear and succinct. Any of DJ Tiësto&#8217;s albums bring this out — in particular listen to &#8220;Sweet Mysery&#8221; on the Just Be album. It is the midtone reproduction with the Beats that I take issue with; it is a bit muffled. Bumping up the 250 &#8211; 2k range a tad makes midtones sound much more reasonable.</p>
<p>One particular measurement metric for audio quality is instrument separation, whether you can hear individual instruments in the music as if they are on their own rather than mixed and coming out as just one sound. This is an area where studio reference headphones and monitors must perform well so producers and studio boffins can accurately know what each change in their mixing sounds like. Unfortunately, this was a bit of a hit or miss with the Beats. At times I was able to detect a slight sense of instrument separation but most of the time, and this was throughout many of the tracks I listened to, it all just sounded mashed together. An example of a song where I was able to hear this favored instrument separation was in the song &#8220;Reckoner&#8217;s Encore&#8221; on the Jaydiohead: Encore mix album.</p>
<p>Overall, <strong>the Beats perform well</strong> and I was most impressed with their ability to <strong>create bass like I&#8217;ve never heard on headphones before</strong>. I enjoy it so much I often adjust my equalizer settings to emphasize bass, such as when I&#8217;m watching <em>Live Free or Die Hard</em> and want to feel the movie, so to speak. <strong>If you don&#8217;t consider yourself an audiophile</strong> (I don&#8217;t) I think you will be happy with the Beats.</p>
<h4>Sound Leak</h4>
<p>Below is a quick video of me showing off one particular issue with the Beats Studio; sound leak. Of course this happens with most headphones but it feels much more apparent with these headphones. Even at a comfortable 25% volume, I think they might be too loud in a library setting. I think it will be pretty easy to tell what song I&#8217;m listening to in this video.</p>

<h4>Beware Wi-Fi</h4>
<p>While reviewing the Beats Studio I did notice one interesting quirk. I was watching an HD movie on my laptop streamed over Wi-Fi from my NAS across the room. I was wearing the Beats and noticed that in certain positions, notably when I pointed my head in the direction of the router, a <strong>prevalent static entered the headphones</strong>. I paused the movie stream and the static went away. I pressed play and the static came back.</p>
<p>I was about 10 feet away from my router — a typical distance for any apartment dweller. Given this experience I can only surmise that the <strong>Beats Studio are susceptible to radio interference</strong> and could use some shielding.</p>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<p>This is the part of the review where I mention how these headphones are expensive and then try to decide if their features, quality and performance can justify the cost. I purchased my Beats Studios for $229 USD from some random e-tailer I found on Froogle. Most retailers like <a title="Beats Studio by Dre Dre - Monster headphones" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Beats_Studio_Monster_Dr_Dre_Headphones">Amazon charge around $299</a> while Monster sells them for a whopping $350. If I had no idea how much the Beats Studio cost and someone asked me to price them, I would say $199 would be a good price; nowhere near $300. The headphones feel like a toy with flimsy construction and cheap materials. Looking around online I have found several reports of ear cushions separating from the ear cups, among other build quality issues.</p>
<p>Another sizable downside to the Beats is their battery requirement. The option to have a non-amplified, passive setting lacking noise-canceling — even at the expense of degraded audio quality — would be a huge boon. I would hate to be traveling and risk carrying around useless headphones for the rest of my trip unless I kept extra AAA batteries handy.</p>
<div class="center"><a title="Beats by Dre logo" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_back_band_1200.jpg"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pstam_dre_beats_back_band.jpg" alt="Beats by Dre logo" /></a></div>
<p>The Beats do have one thing going for them over their more expensive professional counterparts; <strong>they are mobile</strong>. They are lightweight and fold compact with ease. In addition, you don&#8217;t have to deal with some ridiculous 10 foot cord. The included 1.3 meter mini-jack cable is the perfect length for tasks like plugging into your laptop on a flight. The <strong>mute button on the Beats is ideal for one particular scenario that keeps coming to mind — ordering your drink or snack on a flight</strong>. I always have to take out one ear bud and pause my music or movie.</p>
<p>That brings me to one point about flying with headphones or ear buds. From moving about in my seat or leaning over to grab something I always manage knock out my ear buds, which is fine as I would rather that happen than break the headphones port in my laptop. With the Beats though, they are firmly planted on my head and the same action would stress the mini-jacks. That&#8217;s not a big deal for the cable in the headphones, it would just unplug itself. However, depending on where the force is coming from, it could damage the laptop jack. It would be safer if one end of the cable employed a right-angle connector or <a title="Review: Replug for headphones and audio cables" href="http://paulstamatiou.com/review-replug">magsafe-inspired technology from Replug</a>.</p>
<p>I give the Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones by Monster <strong>6 out of 10 Stammy&#8217;s</strong>. If they were $199 I would rate them closer to an 8.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not an audiophile.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the Beats Studio? What headphones or ear buds do you use? Any of them with noise canceling? </strong></p>

I soon realized my interests involved the Internet, web applications and new media. I changed my major a year into my college stay to nurture these interests. While I enjoyed tinkering with electronics &mdash; having designed and printed circuit boards, soldered and built small servo-powered robots for science fairs from a young age &mdash; I did not see how one person could make a huge difference on their own in the hardware field. The typical route was for recent EE/CmpE graduates to work for a large, established hardware company the likes of Intel. It was and remains to be exceedingly difficult for innovative hardware startups to get off the ground without significant capital and a strong team. I need not explain how a few people with computers, vim and an Internet connection can build interesting products and services. <span id="more-6831"></span></p>
<p>It was in that mindset that I began playing around with software (initially MediaWiki, then WordPress). I have <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/you-know-you-go-to-a-tech-school-when" title="You Know You Go To A Tech School When">Georgia Tech to thank</a> for that. My college stay, as devoid of girls (&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLAvhE4a_hI" rel="nofollow">The Ratio</a>&#8220;) as it may have been, introduced me to brilliant hackers that lived on my floor and showed me the ropes of Linux my first year (and one too many attempts at hacking the vending machine in the dorm basement with everything from Ethernet replay attacks and magnetic strip encoders to alter BuzzCard data to random <a href="http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/12/48/" title="Hacking Coke Machines" rel="nofollow">button combinations</a>).</p>
<p>In the summer of 2006 I flew out to California for the first time. Yahoo! had found this blog and wanted me to help them with the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/introducing-yodel-anecdotal" title="Introducing Yodel Anecdotal">development and launch</a> of their <a href="http://ycorpblog.com" title="Yodel Anecdotal - Yahoo!">corporate blog</a>. It was during this trip that I explored Palo Alto, Cupertino, Mountain View and everything else on the 101 and Caltrain. Silicon Valley was lined with technology companies and I knew I wanted to be a part of it eventually. In that and subsequent trips I met long-time Internet friends and made new ones including <a href="http://avalonstar.com" title="Bryan Veloso">Bryan Veloso</a>, <a href="http://warpspire.com" title="Kyle Neath">Kyle Neath</a>, <a href="http://socialuxe.com/" title="Eston Bond at Socialuxe">Eston Bond</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mjmalone" title="Mike Malone">Mike Malone</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/davidu" title="David Ulevitch">David Ulevitch</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/philfreo" title="Phil Freo on Twitter">Phil Freo</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/dimitry" title="Dimitry on Twitter">Dimitry Bentsionov</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/noahkagan" title="Noah Kagan on Twitter">Noah Kagan</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rcrowley" title="Richard Crowley on Twitter">Richard Crowley</a>. Now that list of awesome people has grown to a length that <strong>I cannot ignore</strong>. It has become clear that I would lead a happier life living near my friends.</p>

Not quite sure what part of SF.</small></div>
<p><a href="http://skribit.com" title="Skribit - Cure Writer's Block">Skribit</a> was <em>the</em> reason I remained in Atlanta after <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/thoughts-on-graduating-from-georgia-tech" title="Thoughts on Graduating from Georgia Tech">my graduation</a>, due largely in part to <a href="http://academicvc.com/" title="Stephen Fleming">Stephen Fleming</a>, the Georgia Tech Edison Fund and Co-founder <a href="http://twitter.com/cyu" title="Calvin Yu on Twitter">Calvin Yu</a> along with the best startup mentor I could have ever hoped to find, <a href="http://blog.weatherby.net" title="Lance Weatherby">Lance Weatherby</a>. <strong>Thanks to those folks and many others in the Atlanta tech community</strong> (too many to list, you know who you are) for a wild ride. If I may have one parting wish &mdash; free Wi-Fi in Technology Square (or at least lifetime Wi-Fi for alums).</p>
<p>Skribit is a niche product that serves a small market well and it is with that in mind that <strong>development will continue</strong>, but in a part-time manner. Some changes will be taking place around the site to focus more heavily on converting users to paid Pro accounts (and pay off our convertible note) rather than building out certain community features that require much upkeep; making Skribit more of a tool than a destination. Ultimately, I need to land a paying job and focus on paying off my out-of-state tuition, which is still a six figure number.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m off to San Francisco to <strong>seek interesting opportunities for full-time work and network with friends</strong> that have been telling me to move out there for years. I don&#8217;t think this is the last time I will be seeing Atlanta but for the next few years I will be exploring silicon valley. If you would like to meet up in San Francisco this summer or if you have some interesting ideas about what I should be doing in California, please <strong><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/contact" title="PaulStamatiou.com Contact Form">get in touch with me</a></strong>. I will be on an apartment hunting trip in San Francisco from April 20th to the 26th.</p>

I gave it 10 out of 10 Stammys and had a fantastic time. I just got back from SXSWi 2010 last week and my thoughts have not changed one bit &mdash; in my opinion SXSW remains the best conference of sorts (technically a festival) I have ever attended. While there is good reason to attend SXSW for education purposes and sitting in on some great panels, the best part of <strong>SXSW is the strong networking</strong>, which occurs mainly at various parties every night. However, one main thing did change this year &mdash; there were <em>a lot</em> more people. For another take on the SXSW experience, read Jolie O&#8217;Dell&#8217;s (formerly of ReadWriteWeb) article entitled <a href="http://jolieodell.wordpress.com/2010/03/16/why-sxsw-sucks/" title="Why SXSW Sucks">Why SXSW Sucks</a>. <span id="more-6789"></span></p>

<p>Since many of my sentiments haven&#8217;t changed since what I wrote about in last year&#8217;s post, I will make this more <strong>about pictures</strong>. You can find a lot more SXSW 2010 pictures in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kyeung808/collections/72157623473404155/" title="Ken Yeung SXSW 2010 Flickr Collection">Ken Yeung&#8217;s flickrstream</a> as well.</p>

<p>While I attended many panels last year, this year I didn&#8217;t get around to seeing as many as I wanted. I soon learned that my four hotel roommates did not purchase SXSW badges this year and only came to network and party hop. One big difference from last year was that I reserved my hotel room more than 6 months in advance and was able to snag a room on the top floor of the Hilton. We ran into Jason Calacanis, Jeff Pulver, Robert Scoble, Tony Hsieh (Zappos) and Drew Houston (Dropbox) on our floor the first night.</p>

<p>The typical routine this year went something like this: wake up late, get food, come back to the hotel, change and check email for a while, head out to the first party of the night at 8pm then hop around until the parties end around 3-4am, come back to the Hilton lobby and mingle with many folks until 5:30am when the Hilton&#8217;s pool opened up, swim around for an hour or so, come back to the room, get room service and head to sleep by 8 or 9. And it was with this crazy schedule that I met and got to converse with some interesting folks. Networking at a bar is one thing, but being able to chat about tech with smart people in a hot tub is something not easily forgetten for anyone involved. </p>

<p>One of the biggest takeaways from SXSW was that so many of the attendees seemed to be from San Francisco. So much so that the unofficial slogan of SXSW might as well be &#8220;where San Franciscans go to meet other San Franciscans.&#8221;</p>

Well for one, because 23andMe is at the forefront of technology that is slowly but surely enabling the general public to get access to their genome data that would have cost thousands of dollars just a few years ago. I heard about <strong><a href="http://23andme.com" title="23andMe Personal Genetic Testing">23andMe</a></strong> in 2008, when they were charging $1,000 for a DNA test and access to the results. Now the price is somewhat more reasonable, but still expensive at $399 for access to ancestry information, $429 for health or $499 for both. Each of those prices is just for one person. 23andMe operates in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_genomics" title="Personal Genomics">personal genomics</a> space and they have a few competitors like <a href="http://www.familytreedna.com" title="Family Tree DNA">Family Tree DNA</a> and <a href="http://www.navigenics.com/" title=Navigenics">Navigenics</a> among others. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_ancestry_box_1200.jpg" title="23andMe Genetic DNA testing - Ancestry Edition Box"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_ancestry_box.jpg" alt="23andMe Genetic DNA testing - Ancestry Edition Box"/></a><br/><small>23andMe Genetic DNA testing &#8211; Ancestry Edition Box (but this review is for the Complete Edition, see disclosure notice)</small></div>
<p><span id="more-6704"></span></p>
<p>I decided to give them a shot for almost entirely one reason &mdash; Google co-founder Sergey Brin. He not only financially backs 23andMe but he&#8217;s married to 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki. Brin <a href="http://too.blogspot.com/2008/09/lrrk2.html" title="Sergey Brin blog - Too - LRRK2">blogged about how he used 23andMe</a> to learn more about Parkinson&#8217;s disease in his family:</p>
<blockquote><p>But, of course, I learned something very important to me &#8212; I carry the G2019S mutation and when my mother checked her account, she saw she carries it too.</p>
<p>The exact implications of this are not entirely clear. Early studies tend to have small samples with various selection biases. Nonetheless it is clear that I have a markedly higher chance of developing Parkinson&#8217;s in my lifetime than the average person. In fact, it is somewhere between 20% to 80% depending on the study and how you measure. At the same time, research into LRRK2 looks intriguing (both for LRRK2 carriers and potentially for others).</p>
<p>This leaves me in a rather unique position. I know early in my life something I am substantially predisposed to. I now have the opportunity to adjust my life to reduce those odds (e.g. there is evidence that exercise may be protective against Parkinson&#8217;s). I also have the opportunity to perform and support research into this disease long before it may affect me. And, regardless of my own health it can help my family members as well as others.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, a lot of the technology and processes employed by 23andMe go right over my head. The gist of it seems to be that they use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNP_genotyping" title="SNP genotyping">single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping</a> to analyze more than 580,000 locations in a person&#8217;s genome and find DNA sequence variations. They then compare that to known clinical and research reports backed by many trials proving correlations that certain SNPs have with disease risks and traits, with a certain amount of accuracy (the more people in the study, the more accurate). SNP genotyping is <em>not</em> the same as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_genome_sequencing" title="Full genome sequencing"><strong>F</strong>ull <strong>G</strong>enome <strong>S</strong>equencing</a>, a more complex and accurate process, which used to cost around $50,000 per person just a year ago but is now in the sub-$5,000 range. IBM <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/10/dna-analyzer-on-a-chip/" title="‘DNA Transistor’ Could Revolutionize Genetic Testing - Wired">received some press in late 2009</a> with their efforts to get that down to $1,000 through their &#8220;DNA transistor&#8221; breakthrough.</p>
<p>In a nutshell: personal genetics testing is still maturing and will provide an important platform for medical breakthroughs such as personalized medicine in the near future. At the moment, companies like 23andMe have preliminary offerings aimed at providing consumers with a useful glimpse at what can be found in their DNA: basic ancestral origins, trait comparisons to other individuals, likelihood for certain known diseases and so on. As I will discuss later on, the means through which this data is gained cannot be trusted 100% and it is not entirely clear at all times whether 23andMe uses general data about ethnicity to provide risk correlations (ie, if you are European you are more likely to&#8230;) or personalized &#8220;only you&#8221; type stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> I personally paid $413.95 for the Ancestry Edition then approached 23andMe about receiving an upgrade to the Complete Edition for purposes of this review. They upgraded my 23andMe account free of charge (would have cost me $100).</p>
<h4>Um&#8230; Why?</h4>
<p>Why would I ever plunk down a several hundred dollars to learn more about my genetics? Primarily &mdash; I enjoy discovering new technologies and services first-hand (if you haven&#8217;t noticed already, I&#8217;m an early adopter) so this new-to-me industry was extremely interesting and I just had to grok it. While purchasing this kit I did not know what to expect.. at all. I had grand expectations of having a detailed family tree practically created for me, going back many generations, or getting a peek at how my genes affect my health. </p>
<h4>Unboxing</h4>
<p>After <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/23andMe_Complete_Edition" title=" 23andMe Personal Genome Service: DNA Test for Health and Ancestry Information">ordering the kit online</a>, I received a small box soon after. It was pretty light and there wasn&#8217;t much inside: a spit tube contraption, some documentation, a specimen bag and padded mailer. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_ancestry_unboxed_1200.jpg" title="23andMe Genetic DNA testing - Ancestry Edition unboxed"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_ancestry_unboxed.jpg" alt="23andMe Genetic DNA testing - Ancestry Edition unboxed"/></a></div>
<h4>Spit Acquisition and Delivery</h4>
<p>There was not much involved with sending my DNA sample to 23andMe: spit in the tube a few times to fill it up, close the flip top, unscrew it, replace it with a small cap, shake it up to mix the saliva with the preservation fluid that was in the flip top, place in the specimen bag and mail it to 23andMe.  </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_spit_instructions_1200.jpg" title="23andMe instructions for spit acquisition"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_spit_instructions.jpg" alt="23andMe instructions for spit acquisition"/></a><br/><small>Thorough instructions for spit acquisition</small></div>

<p>After sending the DNA sample, I had to wait around 2-4 weeks to receive access to my results online. But before that could happen I had to setup my 23andMe account and claim my kit with a number that came on the spit tube. </p>
<h4>Online Account Setup</h4>
<p>As you might imagine with such a sensitive subject, there are a few forms you have to read and accept before you can finalize your 23andMe account. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_claim_code_982.jpg" title="23andMe Account Creation - Enter Claim Code"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_claim_code.jpg" alt="23andMe Account Creation - Enter Claim Code"/></a><br/><small>Entering the code that came with the spit tube</small></div>
<p>After typing in the claim code I was greeted with a lengthy document to read through.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_consent_1239.jpg" title="23andMe Account Creation - Consent/Waiver"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_consent.jpg" alt="23andMe Account Creation - Consent/Waiver"/></a><br/><small>Consent and Legal Agreement</small></div>
<p>Here are some items in <a href="https://www.23andme.com/about/consent/" title="consent and legal agreement">the agreement</a> that I found worthy of mentioning:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>While certain genetic markers—SNPs in this case—are associated with a higher incidence of certain diseases or health conditions in certain populations, accessing your genetic information through 23andMe does <strong>not</strong> translate into a personal prediction</li>
<li>Furthermore, the 23andMe Personal Genome Service is <strong>not a test or kit designed to diagnose disease or medical conditions, and it is not intended to be medical advice</strong>.</li>
<li>While we measure many hundreds of thousands of data points from your DNA, only a small percentage of them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions. The research community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important mission of 23andMe is to conduct and contribute to this research. By obtaining 23andMe&#8217;s services, you are agreeing to contribute your genetic information to our research efforts as described below. These efforts could translate into meaningful information about your genetics.</li>
<li><strong>You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate</strong>. This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to alter your life and worldview. You may discover things about yourself that trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g., your father is not genetically your father, surprising facts related to your ancestry, or that someone with your genotype may have a higher than average chance of developing a specific condition or disease). These outcomes could have social, legal, or economic implications.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic data you share with others could be used against your interests.</strong> You should be careful about sharing your genetic information with others. Currently, very few businesses or insurance companies request genetic information, but this could change in the future. While the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was signed into law in the United States in 2008, the protection it will provide against discrimination by employers and health insurance companies for employment and coverage issues has not been clearly established.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic research is not comprehensive</strong>. Many ethnic groups are not included in genetic studies. Because interpretations provided in our service rely on these published studies, some interpretations may not apply to you.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From that agreement I gathered that <strong>23andMe is experimental and very much a work in progress</strong> and that I should not put full confidence in my personal results nor use those results to change the way I currently live.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_consent_form_1019.jpg" title="23andMe Account Creation - Consent/Waiver"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_consent_form.jpg" alt="23andMe Account Creation - Consent/Waiver"/></a></div>
<p>After that legalese there was a page asking whether I wanted to have my saliva sample biobanked. <strong>Biobanking lets 23andMe keep my DNA sample on hand for up to 10 years</strong>. I can see potential cases where this might come in handy when they release a new feature of DNA analysis &mdash; be it advanced SNP genotyping or a take at FGS &mdash; and this would allow me to not have to send in another DNA sample.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_biobank_1176.jpg" title="BioBank your DNA sample at 23andMe"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_biobank.jpg" alt="BioBank your DNA sample at 23andMe"/></a><br/><small>I selected yes, in hopes of getting a call one day that they have successfully cloned me. I rather enjoyed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_6th_Day" title="The 6th Day Movie">The 6th Day</a>.</small></div>
<p>That&#8217;s the last step in the signup process and now I just needed to wait for the DNA sample to arrive and the results to be processed. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_account_created_1268.jpg" title="23andMe Account Created"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_account_created.jpg" alt="23andMe Account Created"/></a></div>
<p>To kill time, 23andMe has lots of surveys users can fill out, ranging from medical history and health habits to a survey about optimism. But I digress, you&#8217;re here to read about the results.</p>
<h4>Ancestry</h4>
<p>I will split the results by Ancestry and Health, since those are two separate versions people can purchase individually or together as the Complete Edition. After a few weeks I got an email saying my results were available online. The <strong>first thing I learned was my maternal and paternal haplogroups</strong>. Yeah, that was my first reaction too &mdash; what&#8217;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup" title="Haplogroup on wikipedia">haplogroup</a>? Fortunately, 23andMe has lots of explanation for every term used on the site.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Haplogroups</strong> are families of mitochondrial DNA types that all trace back to a single mutation at a specific place and time. Technically, every new mutation creates a new haplogroup, but geneticists only label the ones that help them trace significant events in human prehistory, such as the migration of people to the Americas or the expansion of agriculture from the Near East.</p></blockquote>
<p>I discovered my maternal haplogroup was <strong>J1a*</strong> and my paternal haplogroup was <strong>T</strong>. 23andMe also provides some fun comparison info &mdash; for example Thomas Jefferson had the same paternal haplogroup. The site also provides haplogroup trees but they were of no use to me other than an interesting information visualization. So far I haven&#8217;t learned anything remarkable about myself.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_maternal_hap_map_1000.png" title="Maternal Haplogroup Map - 23andMe Genetic Testing"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_maternal_hap_map.png" alt="Maternal Haplogroup Map - 23andMe Genetic Testing"/></a><br/><small>Maternal Haplogroup Map</small></div>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_maternal_hap_tree_1000.png" title="Maternal Haplogroup Tree - 23andMe Genetic Testing"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_maternal_hap_tree.png" alt="Maternal Haplogroup Tree - 23andMe Genetic Testing"/></a><br/><small>Maternal Haplogroup Tree &#8211; interesting visualization but I don&#8217;t really know how this helps me. Although I will say it gets more interesting as you begin sharing genome data with other members of your family/relatives and their icon shows up on the tree.</small></div>
<p><strong>More screenshots:</strong> <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_paternal_hap_map_1000.png" title="Paternal Haplogroup Map - 23andMe Genetic Testing">Paternal Haplogroup Map</a>, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_paternal_hap_hist_1000.png" title="Paternal Haplogroup History - 23andMe Genetic Testing">Paternal Haplogroup History</a>, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_paternal_hap_tree_1000.png" title="Paternal Haplogroup Tree - 23andMe Genetic Testing">Paternal Haplogroup Tree</a>, <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_maternal_hap_hist_1000.png" title="Maternal Haplogroup History - 23andMe Genetic Testing">Maternal Haplogroup History</a></p>
<p>Then there is something called <strong>Ancestry Painting</strong> which displays colored graphics of my chromosomes to trace their ancestry by indicating the geographic origins of each chromosomes and their segments. Mine are all the same color, the key for <strong>which tells me I am 100% European</strong>. Again, something I already knew but interesting to see verified nonetheless.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_ancestry_painting_1000.png" title="Ancestry Painting of Chromosomes on 23andMe"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_ancestry_painting.png" alt="Ancestry Painting of Chromosomes on 23andMe"/></a><br/><small>Ancestry Painting</small></div>
<p>Moving on, there is a <strong>Global Similarity</strong> feature that tells me I am most similar to people from Southern Europe and has a chart conveying my similarity to other people based on geographic origins. Again, nothing quite mind-blowing.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_global_similarity_1000.png" title=""><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_global_similarity.png" alt=""/></a></div>
<p>Then there is <strong>Ancestry Labs</strong> that has some experimental features like &#8220;Haplogroup Tree Mutation Mapper&#8221; and &#8220;Family Inheritance: Advanced.&#8221; The former was of little use to me and provided me with some raw data while the latter, described as &#8220;Compare your DNA, bit by bit, to see what segments you share with close and distant family&#8221;, would be interesting if I had any family or relatives on 23andMe that took the DNA test as well and shared their genomes with my account.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andMe_ancestry_labs.png" alt="Ancestry Labs at 23andMe"/><br/><small>Ancestry Labs</small></div>
<p><strong>So far</strong>.. well I am kind of disappointed. I have not learned much about my ancestry that I did not already know but what I did already know was presented to me in an instructional manner with nice graphics and background information. Oh, but what is this <strong>Relative Finder</strong> feature I seemed to have skipped over?</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_relative_finder_1000.png" title=""><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_relative_finder.png" alt=""/></a></div>
<p><strong>23andMe found 17 people in its database (of around 35,000 people) that it thinks <em>might</em> be 3rd, 4th, 5th or distant cousins of mine. This got interesting when one of them, marked as a 3rd cousin, contacted me.</strong> The site has a unique way of letting potential relatives contact each other, with privacy in mind first. Before I could continue contacting the relative there was a warning about how reaching out to potential relatives may freak them out or be unwanted news (in more professional terms of course). It should be noted that <strong>23andMe users can opt out of this entirely</strong>. There are two checkboxes in the privacy tab of the settings:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>I do not want to receive sharing invitations from anyone.</li>
<li>I do not want to participate in Relative Finder.<br/><br/>
<p>By checking this box, your profile (Paul Stamatiou) will not be able to use Relative Finder to view or contact relatives. Also, you will not show up in other people&#8217;s Relative Finder results. If you change your mind, you may re-join at any time by unchecking the box.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I accepted my potential 3rd cousin&#8217;s request for contact and I shared my genetic data with him and he shared his as well.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_relative_contact.png" alt="Contact Potential Relatives on 23andMe"/></div>
<p>23andMe lets you share this data in stages &mdash; Basic and Extended &mdash; depending on how much access you want to provide this person. This let me use the <strong>Compare Genes</strong> feature to see some neat similarities I share with this person.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_compare_genes_1000.png" title="Compare Genes tool - 23andMe"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_compare_genes.png" alt="Compare Genes tool - 23andMe"/></a><br/><small>The Compare Genes tool is likely even more useful if you have direct family on 23andMe sharing their genetic data with you. A related feature called Inheritance Calculator lets you select two people and see their offsprings potential traits.</small></div>
<p>At the moment I am still talking with this person to verify if and how we are actually related. He currently lives in a part of Greece (Heraklion, Crete) where my mother is from, so there&#8217;s a good chance he is a relative. <del datetime="2010-03-09T23:31:10+00:00">23andMe states that his paternal haplogroup is the same as my maternal haplogroup, so by that I know my mother&#8217;s side of the family could be related to his father&#8217;s side</del> (Update from comments: turns out the haplogroups just have the same name and are unrelated). We are exchanging family information like last names of other relatives and so on. Google tells me he is a computer-savvy 30 year old. Then again I have many 2nd and 3rd cousins all over Greece so it&#8217;s not like this was a landmark discovery. However, the chances that someone related to me in Greece heard about some genetic startup called 23andMe and forked over the many Euros to try this service must be fairly small. </p>
<p>Relative Finder is one of the newest features at 23andMe and <strong>by far the most useful in my opinion</strong>, even compared to some of the health features below. </p>
<h4>Health</h4>
<p>Now on to the reports 23andMe provides with their Health Edition. There are three sections: <a href="https://www.23andme.com/health/all/" title="23andMe Health Reports">Clinical Reports, Research Reports</a> and Health Labs. There are currently <strong>51 clinical reports</strong> on the site divided up into <strong>categories of Carrier Status, Disease Risk, Drug Response and Traits</strong>. Clinical reports are the most accurate of any other health-related data on the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clinical Reports give you information about conditions and traits for which there are genetic associations supported by multiple, large, peer-reviewed studies. Those associations must also have a substantial influence on a person&#8217;s chances of developing the disease or having the trait. Because these associations are widely regarded as reliable, we use them to develop quantitative estimates and definitive explanations of what they mean for you.</p></blockquote>

This is part of a page on <strong>muscle performance</strong> that states I have a certain type of fast muscle fiber. </small></div>
<p>Research reports on the other hand give you information based on research with limited scientific evidence and have thus not been demonstrated through large, replicated studies. 23andMe currently provides 88 research reports.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andMe_research_reports_1000.png" title="23andMe Research Reports Overview"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andMe_research_reports.png" alt="23andMe Research Reports Overview"/></a><br/><small>Research Reports separated by risk and research confidence</small></div>

<p>Similar to how there is an Ancestry Labs section, 23andMe also has <strong>Health Labs</strong> for showcasing experimental features that &#8220;may still be in development, require specialized knowledge or be of interest only to a subset of our customers.&#8221; Currently I only see three inside of Health Labs: Reynolds Risk Score (10-year risk for heart-attack), Genetic Weight Calculator (how much of your weight you can blame on your genes) and ABO Blood Type (find your probable blood type).</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andMe_health_labs_genweight_1000.png" title="Genetic Weight Calculator - Health Labs at 23andMe"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andMe_health_labs_genweight.png" alt="Genetic Weight Calculator - Health Labs at 23andMe"/></a></div>
<p>While I did not find much value in the Ancestry Edition results, with the sole exception of Relative Finder, Health Edition results were more intriguing and provided me with little tidbits about myself. Of those tidbits was a laundry list of diseases I might be at risk for: something that might be <strong>heavy news for many folks and explains why 23andMe warned</strong> about the effects of receiving such information in their legal and consent agreement. Nothing I learned about myself was life-changing but I did learn some interesting things. For example, according to a research report (not clinical), my body metabolizes caffeine quickly and does not increase my risk of heart attack and may even reduce the risk. That is relevant to my interests as I have a passion for all things caffeinated, although I have stopped drinking soda ever <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/thoughts-on-graduating-from-georgia-tech" title="Thoughts on Graduating from Georgia Tech">since I got out of college</a>. According to a clinical report I have two working copies of a fast twitch muscle fiber, which potentially makes me well-suited for thngs like sprinting versus endurance running. I also learned that I am resistant to norovirus strains (&#8220;stomach flu&#8221;) and that I have a decreased risk of developing Parkinson&#8217;s disease based on the research currently available (I lack the LRRK2 G2019S mutation).</p>
<p>23andMe has several reports that are &#8220;locked.&#8221; When clicking on these reports, users are told how the information to be presented is not thorough and only checks certain mutations associated with the disease or carrier at hand. The user then must click through to unlock the report. Several reports also have useful sections explaining genes versus environment that describe how genetic factors may contribute more or less than environmental factors.</p>
<h4>Advanced</h4>
<p>For those that are more do-it-yourself and were awake during their 8am honors genetics and bioinformatics collegiate class, 23andMe also offers <strong>full access to raw data</strong>. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_browse_raw_data_2000.png" title="Browse raw genetic data on 23andMe"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pstam_23andme_browse_raw_data.png" alt="Browse raw genetic data on 23andMe"/></a><br/><small>Click the image to get a view of more advanced genetic data.</small></div>
<h4>Verdict</h4>
<p>I acknowledge that <strong>many people have no desire to pay $400-$500</strong> for this type of information. On the other hand, a growing minority of people find great value in 23andMe&#8217;s offerings. I believe it is a remarkable field and we are living in a great time to have such advanced personal genetics information readily available to the public. If 23andMe&#8217;s legal and consent agreement offers any hints, it is that this is by far <strong>a very early-stage offering</strong> and results are not as accurate as they could be. That being said it is msot definitely a great insight into what is to come. Clinical and research reports are continually being added and updated.</p>
<p><strong>I had a hard timing trying to decide how to rate 23andMe</strong>. There are a few reasons. For one, it&#8217;s a relatively new company in a developing space trying to offer cost-effective solutions to the public. You know how technology works; you just <em>can&#8217;t</em> expect any just service to be perfect the first time around, <em>especially</em> in such a volatile space where new processes are being evaluated incessantly. Second, 23andMe&#8217;s <strong>offerings become exponentially more useful</strong> the more people in your family you add to your account. You can compare genome data, build a family tree, see what traits might get passed down to potential offspring, find out what disease risks run in the family and much more. Of course that would run $400-$500 per person. Perhaps a family package would be interesting: $1,500 for up to 5 people.</p>
<p>23andMe receives <strong>8 out of 10</strong> Stammys.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about 23andMe and services like it in general? Would you be interested in trying it out? If not, why? Privacy reasons or cost? At what price would you consider checking out such a personal genetics service. What interests you most about this space? Leave a comment down below and let me know whats on your mind! Thanks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notice:</strong> To protect myself from this data getting in the hands some potentially evil entity, like my health insurance company, I have manually altered some data presented in screenshots via Firebug (not Photoshop, aside from blurring out someone else&#8217;s name). This does not affect anything in my review or how their results look. </p>
<p><strong>Update 3/5/10 @ 6:15pm:</strong> Some great conversation about this post going on at <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz/louisgray/ZMEciBEeakh/Review-23andMe-DNA-Testing-for-Health-Disease" title="Review 23andMe DNA Testing for Health Disease Ancestry at Google Buzz">Louis Gray&#8217;s Google Buzz</a>, including some comments by Linda Avey of 23andMe:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is one of the most thorough and accurate summaries I&#8217;ve seen (I&#8217;m the co-founder of 23andMe). One small point&#8230;the testing technology 23andMe uses is highly accurate, it&#8217;s just the interpretation of what the datapoints means which is, in some cases, early and subject to revision (this would be equally true if you sequenced the entire genome vs. genotyping, which is the SNP-based technique used by 23andMe).<br/><Br/></p>
<p>Getting wider diversity in genetics research is a key objective of 23andMe&#8230;need to figure out ways to attract people of all backgrounds. Once we have enough representation of any given population, the statisticians can see if genetic associations replicate (or discover new ones!). Filling out the surveys is a much-appreciated contribution.<br/><br/>-<strong>Linda Avey</strong></p></blockquote>

You might remember the first two Startup Riots which I blogged about: I presented at the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/startup-riot-recap" title="Startup Riot 2008 Recap">Startup Riot 2008</a> and covered <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/startup-riot-2009-recap" title="Startup Riot 2009 Recap">Startup Riot 2009</a>. I&#8217;ll backtrack a bit first. Startup Riot 2010 is a startup pitch event and this year 50 startups in Atlanta, GA will take the stage for 3 minutes or less and talk about their startup company with just 4 slides. It&#8217;s an all day event and by far a pillar event for the growing Atlanta tech community. That being said, <a href="http://twitter.com/scobleizer" title="Robert Scoble">Robert Scoble</a> came into town this week to attend Startup Riot.  He works for RackSpace <a href="http://www.building43.com/" title="RackSpace Building43">Building43</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2008/10/22/rackspace-acquires-jungledisk-slicehost-to-take-on-amazon-web-services/" title="RackSpace Acquires Jungle Disk">RackSpace bought local startup Jungle Disk</a> last year, so they decided to fly out from California to meet with the Jungle Disk team and network with local startups. Skribit Co-founder Calvin Yu and I went to the Jungle Disk offices yesterday for a video interview with Scoble that I&#8217;ll post up soon.</p>

<p>Now on to the point of this post. I am going to attempt to live blog Startup Riot today. This is my first time live blogging so there will likely be some snags along the way. Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>The event will be also be streamed live at <strong><a href="http://live.startupriot.com/" title="Startup Riot live">live.startupriot.com</a></strong>.</p>
<h4>Live Blog Coverage</h4>

<p><strong>8:44am</strong> Wi-Fi is acting up, hopefully they&#8217;re just rebooting it or something. </p>
<p><strong>8:53am</strong> Voice over the PA says everything will start in 2 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>8:58am</strong> Sanjay up making jokes and trying to stop people from eating doughnuts and come sit down.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/startup_riot_859am.jpg" alt="Sanjay starting his slides- Startup Riot Live blog"/></div>
<p><strong>9:01am</strong> Sanjay starting his 41 slide deck. Talking about success of Startup Riot. 400 people in attendance today.</p>
<p><strong>9:02am</strong> Sanjay telling people how to pronounce his name. He does this a lot. </p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/startup_riot_901am.jpg" alt="Sanjay pronunciation- Startup Riot Live blog"/></div>
<p><strong>9:04am+</strong> Sanjay talking Startup Riot basics. Big sponsors: Georgia Tech ATDC (disclosure Skribit is a member) and Jungle Disk.

<p><strong>9:12am</strong> Wi-Fi keeps crashing. This makes Stammy sad.</p>
<p><strong>9:13am</strong> Sanjay talking about his startup gossip mailing list. I&#8217;ve been subscribing for a while and have advertised in it for the last 2 months. Also mentioned <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/shotput-ventures-to-grow-tech-startups-in-atlanta" title="Shotput Ventures to grow tech startups in Atlanta">Shotput Ventures</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9:15am</strong> Sanjay introducing the keynote speaker, Bo Peabody:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bo is an <a href="http://www.villageventures.com/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/104" rel="nofollow">accomplished entrepreneur and investor</a>.  He co-founded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod.com">Tripod.com</a> in 1994 and co-founded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_Ventures">Village Ventures</a> in 1999.  Bo&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439210101?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=paulstamatiou-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=1439210101">Lucky or Smart?</a>, is available on Amazon. Wikipedia entry on Bo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Peabody">here</a>.</p>
<p>You should also read this recent Washington Post piece that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/25/AR2009092502547.html">Bo did on social media, startups, and advertising models</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>9:16am</strong> Bo takes the stage. Dude looks at least 15 years younger than I thought he would be.</p>
<p><strong>9:17am+</strong> Bo talking about his titles. He has been CEO of various companies and is now a venture capitalist. He also has a few restaurants.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/startup_riot_bopeabody.jpg" alt="Bo Peabody at Startup Riot"/></div>
<p>Bo talking about how he wanted to be an entrepreneur when young and how his friends were all getting high-paying jobs right out of college. &#8220;What exactly does an entrepreneur do?&#8221; Talking about meeting women in a bar and how saying you are an entrepreneur is like &#8220;this guy is unemployed.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>9:25am</strong> Wi-Fi keeps dying and being slow. Sorry for the delay guys.</p>
<p><strong>9:26am</strong> Bo talking about how every successful company at one point was very close to shutting down. At Tripod they wanted to provide 90% of the content and the audience would add 10% of the content by talking about it&#8230; was actually the other way around once they started working with it. This was in mid 90&#8242;s. Once they started seeing how the Internet worked, it took off.</p>
<p>Bo is now talking about his restaurant group Mezze. Tweaked to success: raised the lighting in the restaurant and made meals larger portion sizes, attracted an older crowd and got more business out of it.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship is all about passion.</p>
<p><strong>9:30am</strong> Bo takling about his sections of his book: Humilty &#8211; don&#8217;t believe your own press, and Level-Headedness &#8211; Best defense is a gracious offense. Just because he had a great piece on the USA Today, he shouldn&#8217;t have scrapped his great talk assuming that everyone read the great news piece. He was at a speaking gig on a book tour and asked the audience who read his book &#8211; no one raised their hand.</p>
<p><strong>9:34am</strong> Story about a big meeting with some movie producers. Made tons of plans. Movie producer assistant called.. had to change meeting. Bo changed plans again. Two days later they call back again saying that day isn&#8217;t going to work. They reschedule again. Another call, that day won&#8217;t work either. They schedule once more time, Bo is pissed but talking about being gracious. Being an entrepreneur &#8211; constantly getting screwed. Time changed again, he told them &#8220;look, I&#8217;m going to be out in LA for an entire week.. if there is any 30 minute point at which I can meet with him, I can do it.&#8221; Assistant says &#8220;great&#8221;.. calls back right before the trip and has the final date. Bo goes to the meeting and gets the deal done. Enterpreneurship &#8211; gotta stick with it.</p>
<p><strong>9:38am</strong> Bo talking about the VC fund he works with, Village Ventures &#8211; currently $134M. I need to pitch this guy..</p>
<p><strong>9:39am</strong> Q&#038;A starting&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to raise funding&#8230; I&#8217;m getting blown off a lot as well. Meetings cancelled, etc. Tell me the story of the first time you raised funding. Also, if you don&#8217;t have any connection.. how do you get in when you&#8217;ve got no lead?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bo says: you have a connection. Think about who you know and you&#8217;ll find someone with money &#8211; they might not be a traditional investor but they can connect you with who you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>&#8220;What cosmic set of circumstances must occur for you to say yes to a deal?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bo says: Running a venture firm is just like running a business, just like you. When we&#8217;re dealing with a limited partner as a customer, we tell them a story. They remember that story pretty well.. if we veer from that story it creates problems with them as a customer. The story he tells them: I&#8217;m investing primarily in vertical media companies. Ones that are building out audiences in particular set of verticals that he has marked as being valuable to advertisers and consumers. First thing that has to happen &#8211; you have to be doing something that is interesting to me. Tells entrepreneurs to do their homework, look at their websites to find what they invest in and look at their portfolio companies. </p>
<p>&#8220;What are the verticals that you invest in?&#8221;</p>
<p>Travel, Health, Beauty &#038; Fashion, Parenting, Technology Media, Financial Services Media, Food &#038; Wine, Education</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi Bo &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to raise capital for a startup in Zambia, Africa. Investors are scared in funding in an emerging markets. Advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bo says: I think your best bet is to get to individuals who have an interest in Africa. Have invested in startups in Africa, et cetera. My guess is that a venture firm is not your best route. </p>
<p>&#8220;How much does geography play a role in investments?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bo says: It&#8217;s hard for me to invest in a company in LA, even though I think there is an opportunity out there in video and content creation etc, it&#8217;s really hard for me to manage a relationship that is a 3 hour time difference and 3,000 miles away. Focus on getting to local people in regards to funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;First Round Capital put together this entrepreneur equity share thing&#8230; diversification&#8221;</p>
<p>Bo says: Diversification is a good thing but I don&#8217;t want to back a company that is giving away their own companies equity. They should value their company&#8217;s equity very highly, more so than someone else&#8217;s startup.</p>
<p><strong>10am</strong> Bo is done speaking. Sanjay is back on stage. We have a break now.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/startup_riot_break.jpg" alt="Startup Riot 2010 demo companies"/></div>

The former because I am not quite sure everyone here would be interested in reading about anything except the technology behind the car and the latter because most iPhone apps do not have enough substance and utility to create a compelling review. Well I am breaking both of those rules today and for good reason. A few months ago I discovered a $40 iPhone app by <a href="http://www.devtoaster.com/products/rev/" title="Rev iPhone app by DevToaster">DevToaster called Rev</a>.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://www.devtoaster.com/products/rev/" title="Rev iPhone app by DevToaster"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/pstam_devtoaster_rev_banner.jpg" alt="Rev iPhone app by DevToaster"/></a></div>
<p><span id="more-6579"></span></p>
<h4>What it does</h4>
<p>At $40 for an iPhone app, Rev is most definitely not cheap compared to other iPhone apps. The only iPhone app I have purchased that was pricier was Navigon GPS and I rarely use it. However, when you are put into the mindset of a true car nut that spends over $300 just to install a single boost gauge, $2000 for a pair of cheap racing seats, $2000 for a basic coilover suspension setup, $400 for a professional dyno tuning session, $500 for a polished throttle body/plenum assembly, $15k for a crate engine and then $10k for a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pauls/3204356634/in/set-72157612629298213/" rel="nofollow">custom twin turbo setup</a> and so on, then a $40 iPhone app is like an impulse buy of a Snickers bar at the grocery checkout. </p>
<p>There are several use cases for the Rev iPhone app, best described by the video below, but in a nutshell <strong>Rev gives car enthusiasts access to detailed metrics</strong> about their car&#8217;s performance, the ability to create a custom gauge cluster, check engine codes, log data and lap times along with GPS. It&#8217;s one of the most comprehensive vehicle tools I have seen. It is, however, a more involved setup than some of those automotive iPhone apps that rely solely on the iPhone&#8217;s accelerometer. Rev requires that you <strong>install an OBDII module</strong> in your car that provides real-time data from your car&#8217;s ECU to the iPhone &mdash; in this case via a Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<div class="center"><object width="620" height="380"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NG9qCdblAzc&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NG9qCdblAzc&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="620" height="380"></embed></object><br/><small>The official DevToaster Rev product video &#8211; shows off different use cases</small></div>
<p>OBDII is a standard port on all 1996+ cars and provides onboard diagnostics information. If you look under your car&#8217;s steering wheel it will be somewhere there &mdash; car manufacturers are required by law to place the OBDII port within ~6 inches of the steering column. All OBDII ports are also required by law to utilize a friction fit and no snap lock, so installation is as simple as plugging in the module.</p>
<h4>Why I got it</h4>
<p>While others may be interested in using such a setup to keep an eye on MPG or checking engine codes, I purchased the Kiwi and Rev for the purpose of showing additional gauges and logging lap data. In my car I have relatively few gauges: tachometer, speed and fuel level. As someone that is very much into modifying cars and experimenting with various ECU tunes, I would like to keep an eye on air to fuel ratio, engine temperature, et cetera (note: some vehicles don&#8217;t have all these sensors and you may need to purchase the Kiwi version with iMFD and install your own sensors). Rather than purchasing and installing an expensive gauge cluster behind the steering wheel or in the A-pillar, I decided to check out Rev. </p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/pstam_plx_kiwi_wifi_iphone_1200.jpg" title="iPhone 3GS and Rev app with PLX Devices Kiwi Wifi unboxed"><img src="http://paulstamatiou.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/pstam_plx_kiwi_wifi_iphone.jpg" alt="iPhone 3GS and Rev app with PLX Devices Kiwi Wifi unboxed"/></a><br/><small>iPhone 3GS and Rev app with unboxed PLX Devices Kiwi Wifi</small></div>
<p>Of course there are <strong>a few downsides to this approach</strong>. For one it involves using an iPhone mount that can obstruct road view when mounted to the windshield (alternatively it can be mounted lower elsewhere but that defeats the purpose if you must constantly look down to check gauges, unless you are purely using it for logging purposes) and second if you do not always remove the iPhone windshield mount when parked, that imposes a break-in risk (even if the iPhone isn&#8217;t there, it has been said that thieves assume the device is hidden in the glove box and will break-in regardless. I have also even been told by a local police officer that some thieves look for windshield suction cup marks, so if you live in a crime infested neighborhood, keep a cloth and rubbing solution handy).</p>
<h4>What you need</h4>

<ul>
<li>iPhone (3G or 3GS if you want GPS logging functionality)</li>
<li>Some sort of iPhone mount. Rev displays and logs G-force data but requires that the iPhone stays perfectly steady after calibrated in a certain position. I went with the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Griffin_WindowSeat_iPhone_mount" title="Griffin WindowSeat iPhone and iPod mount">Griffin WindowSeat iPhone windshield mount</a> but found the suction cup weak and hard to engage. Anyone have any better suggestions?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>iPhone car charger. Having the Rev app open all the time sucks battery life. I got the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/Griffin_PowerJolt_USB_charger" title="Griffin PowerJolt Dual USB charger">Griffin PowerJolt USB charger</a> and think it&#8217;s one of the best ones out now. It&#8217;s compact and has 2 USB ports.</li>
<li>Rev iPhone app</li>
<li>A wireless OBDII module. There are several of these on the market but I decided on the <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/PLX_Devices_Kiwi_Wifi" title="PLX Devices Kiwi Wifi OBDII module">PLX Devices Kiwi Wifi</a> (~$150) and have been happy with it. There is a <a href="http://www.plxkiwi.com/kiwiwifi/hardware.html" title="PLX Devices">pricier version (~$250) of the Kiwi Wifi</a> that lets you add other sensors.</li>
</ul>
