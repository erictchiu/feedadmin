We think this makes it more fun to come to work in the morning, and makes a programmer feel more like a craftsman than a mechanic.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br /></div><div>We're focused on disciplined application of best practices.

A key strategy contributing to these companies' success has been the development of internal software solutions to increase the efficiency of the people who develop the products. While working at these companies, we split our efforts between building the products used by hundreds of millions of people and the internal systems which enabled our teams to do so quickly, collaboratively, and enjoyably.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br /></div><div>We founded Asana to dedicate our attention full-time to developing a beautifully intuitive collaborative information manager which can help any company work more efficiently. Our system speeds up knowledge work and communication by minimizing the time leaders spend trying to keep everyone on the same page and the time that knowledge workers sink into struggling with disparate tools to do their jobs.</div><div class="paragraph_break"><br /></div><div>We're currently mobilizing a team of world-class peers, and actively recruiting new team members who are passionate about tackling some of the hardest software engineering and product design problems out there.</div>
