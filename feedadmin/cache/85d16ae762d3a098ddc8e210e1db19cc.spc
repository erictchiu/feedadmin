<p><strong>I HATE LOSING</strong>. I hate it.  I really, really, really hate it.  It chaps my hide.  It rips at my core.  I don&#8217;t get over it easily.  I lose sleep.  I fucking hate losing.  It&#8217;s not so much the actual outcome that I hate &#8211; it&#8217;s the process.  The fact that I lost when I should have won.</p>
<p>I think about it for months, often years.  But I embrace losing.  It is how I learn.  I relive the moment so many times over in my mind wondering if I could have done this differently or if I shouldn&#8217;t have said or done this or that.  I talk to trusted sources about it.  I ask for feedback.  I hate losing.  I don&#8217;t want to lose next time.</p>
<p>I believe that it is part of the DNA of an entrepreneur &#8211; being so competitive that you&#8217;re practically sick when you lose.  It&#8217;s what makes you stand out from the rest.  Entrepreneurs are neurotic about it.  They&#8217;re competitive.  It&#8217;s the one thing I miss having switched from player to manager &#8211; I love the joy of winning and of competing.  It is never as rewarding when you&#8217;re the coach (but coaching has many other benefits <img src='http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; I&#8217;m not a sore loser.  I don&#8217;t break tennis rackets, cry foul, fall over like an Italian soccer player or work the referees.  Quite the opposite.  I&#8217;m usually quite a gracious loser.  I don&#8217;t hold grudges.  I move on.  I keep my competitors as friends and those that didn&#8217;t choose me or my product as friends, too.  But I never really get over it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking about garden-variety losses &#8211; that sort of loss I get over in a couple of days or weeks (but you don&#8217;t want to be around me that evening for sure).  I not even too bothered by the occasional deal that got away.  I&#8217;m talking about the hard fought battle.  The one that you thought you had.  The one you were counting on.  I&#8217;m talking Tom Watson at the British Open or Andy Roddick at Wimbledon.</p>
<p><strong>On Losing in VC</strong></p>
<p>Last year I lost a deal in a company that I wanted to invest in and that I thought I should have won.  I was angry &#8211; mostly at myself.  Rather than blame the team that I thought should have chosen me, I became reflective.  They were in LA and I was in LA.  They had a prominent NorCal investor already so I thought a SoCal lead would make sense &#8211; that I could help them in a more hands-on way.  They had agreed!</p>
<p>I had lost a previous deal where the team said they liked me but didn&#8217;t know my partners well enough so I promised myself never to let that happen again.</p>
<p>So I organized a team dinner with all four of my partners and all three of their founders.  I wanted to be sure that they knew how much all of our partners loved what they were doing with their company.  I wanted to be sure that they felt they knew all of my partners well so they could see why I joined up with them in the first place &#8211; they are smart guys who have a 20-year track record of winning.  15 companies North of $1 billion exit.  And they are normal, down-to-earth people as well.</p>
<p>After dinner on a Thursday night I thought we had the deal and that the team knew how hard I would work on their behalf if I were chosen.  By Monday morning after their board meeting in NorCal I didn&#8217;t get a return phone call.  I knew what this meant.  Good news always comes quickly, bad news takes time to simmer.  By the time I got through to the guys on Tuesday we had lost.</p>
<p>I knew that the, &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry&#8221; message was coming.  I embraced it with honor and didn&#8217;t give them a hard time.  But I obviously asked, &#8220;Why did it happen? I need to learn for next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were two main reasons that I could distill from their kind words of solace:  1) the existing NorCal investor didn&#8217;t know me well enough &amp; 2) the new NorCal investor had a good knowledge of and presence in China, which they believed would be critical.</p>
<p>I decided to put both of those issues to bed in 2010.  I came several times to NorCal (where I grew up, actually) and went and met several partners from each Silicon Valley firm.  I didn&#8217;t want this to happen again &#8211; that people didn&#8217;t know me.  I also made several trips to New York &amp; Boston.  Next year I&#8217;m going to spend time in Seattle and Boulder in addition.  I realized that it is not enough to know one partner per firm and it is not enough for only the management team to like you.  VCs have a seat at the table in deciding future investors.</p>
<p>I also spent two weeks in China and vowed to make it back frequently.  China is indelibly an important part of the future of the global technology system.  Although I had lived and worked in more than 10 countries &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t good enough. I didn&#8217;t know the one that mattered most to their future.  And for my own good I vowed to have relationships in China and knowledge of the local markets.  I&#8217;m not looking to invest there &#8211; I&#8217;m looking to understand the trends, the people, the innovation, the regions and how China can become an integral part of any of my portfolio companies as they scale.</p>
<p>I know I won&#8217;t win every deal I want to in VC.  There are other great VC&#8217;s in SoCal and there is always the allure of the NorCal guys flying down and talking about how they invested in Google, Facebook, Yahoo! or eBay.  But I will learn from any deals that I want to do and am not able to do.  I will embrace my losses.  May they be few and far between.  I can&#8217;t afford more sleepless nights.</p>
<p>This company is back on the market raising money again.  I love the area and the team as much now as I did a year ago &#8211; probably even more now that I know them better and have seen them perform.  I&#8217;m dropping everything non-portfolio related in the next few weeks and setting my sights on righting my wrong.  One great thing about losing is when you get a second chance.  I hope the next chapter will be written by the victor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Make sure you learn your lessons from losses.  Specifically:</span></strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="lockerroom1_original185842" src="http://marksuster.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/lockerroom1_original185842.jpg?w=300" alt="lockerroom1_original185842" width="300" height="225" /><strong>1. Ask your customer why you lost.</strong> Tell them that you&#8217;d like to learn so that you can improve.  Promise you won&#8217;t be defensive or try to change the decision.  Best to ask after the dust from the decision has settled.  Ask multiple people involved with the decision.  Be gracious.  Write things down.</p>
<p><strong>2. Discuss with your team </strong>- do your post game analysis.  Don&#8217;t ignore your losses.  Don&#8217;t blame the people involved with the loss.  Don&#8217;t accept your internal team&#8217;s answer of why you lost &#8211; hear it for yourself.  Make sure that you hear all of your team&#8217;s perspective.  Draw your own independent conclusions &#8211; even if they are different from other people&#8217;s point of view.</p>
<p><strong>3. Triangulate. </strong> Who else was involved with the decision?  Were their consultants?  Can you discuss further down the line with your competitor?  Do you have friends on the inside?  The clearer picture you have of why you lost the more you&#8217;ll learn for next time.</p>
<p><strong>4. Learn.  And don&#8217;t make the same mistake twice</strong>.  Obvious, but I find that some people just never learn.  I read<a href="http://blog.precipice.org/why-wesabe-lost-to-mint" target="_blank"> this post from Marc Hedlund at Wesabe</a> on why they lost to Mint.  It&#8217;s one of my favorite blog posts.  I don&#8217;t know Marc but now I feel I want to work with him after reading this.  I had planned to blog about it at the time but I waited 2 days and the whole world blogged about it so I didn&#8217;t pile on.  If you never read it, please do.  It&#8217;s brilliant, reflective &amp; humble.  And I think he&#8217;s right that Mint never solved the problems the industry wanted to solve.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">A personal story of losing a sale that haunted me for years</span></strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-708" title="soccer loss" src="http://marksuster.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/soccer-loss.jpg?w=300" alt="soccer loss" width="300" height="193" /></p>
<p>In the 2003/04 timefame I was living in the UK and running my first company.  I had been competing to win a contract at Thames Water, the largest water company in the UK.  They were looking for a collaboration tool to manage all of their large water development projects.  The initial contract was worth about $500,000 and the whole value of the contract would have been worth a couple of million over the years.  I was working hand-in-hand with my close friend and associate <a href="http://blog.publicspend.com/publicspend/blog/">Stuart Lander</a> who was running our UK office and with one of our local sales reps.</p>
<p>We had initially been told that we had no chance because they had previously purchased Documentum and it would mean changing the system entirely.  They had a team trained up in Documentum and we certainly had enemies from the inside.  But we worked the account tirelessly for months.  We helped the write out their requirements for a system.  We met everybody in the organization.  We had every reference client we worked with call their senior team members (we had already won a major project at Scottish Water, Anglian Water and another at a large water company in Paris, France).</p>
<p>There were about 8 initial contenders for the work and in the end it came down to just 3 of us.  As the founder &amp; CEO I personally went and met with as many people at Thames Water as I could.  We felt this was a marquee account and one that would help us take our collaboration tool global as Thames owned assets all over the world.  Winning the contract meant that we would hit our quarterly revenue figure and be in good position for our annual sales target.</p>
<p>And then the news came.    A woman named Trish Hannon called me with the good news that we had won the project.  I was to tell noone until the contract was signed.  I immediately put a full team on contract management and another on drawing up an implementation plan.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-713" title="Defeat" src="http://marksuster.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/defeated-boxer.jpg?w=201" alt="Defeat" width="201" height="300" />I later learned one of my biggest lesson in sales.  You are most vulnerable right after you have won a deal.  It is when you&#8217;re competitors have nothing to lose.  It&#8217;s when the people who are part of the decision making process who don&#8217;t support the decision seek ways to undermine you.  That is when you potentially become complacent.</p>
<p>Two weeks after winning the deal and well into implementation planning we released a new version of our software.  We had made the decision that we would no longer be supporting IE v 5.5 (we would support 6.0 and 7.0, which was in beta).  Even Microsoft publicly said that there were security flaws with 5.5 and that people should upgrade.   But Thames Water was still on version 5.5.  We assumed they would take our advice and upgrade.  We had discussed this with Trish.</p>
<p>An internal resource inside Thames Water used our upgrade and lack of 5.5 support as a way to re-open the decision.  How could a company like ours be so callous as not to support their software (even one more than 4 years out of date)?  Did we really have good change management procedures if we were willing to launch products without backward compatibility. And so on.  They decided to re-open the competition for 3-4 more weeks.  I knew THEN that we had lost.  We fought hard to stay in the game.</p>
<p>They hired a consultant to help them with the review.  They stopped allowing us to contact them directly.  The momentum had shifted.  Something happened and it was clear to me that this IE issues was just a smoke screen.  Somebody had gotten to somebody senior in the Thames organization.  It just so happened that the consultant they hired to chose a software vendor worked for a company that had owned one of our competitors.  It was a tiny little collaboration company that only had a presence in the UK (and therefore couldn&#8217;t meet their international needs).   And surprise, surprise the decision came back 3 weeks later than none of the preferred 3 vendors had won but rather this tiny little competitor owned by the consulting company charged with doing the review.</p>
<p>Outrage.  Scandal.  Surely inside Thames they would see it for what it was.  Given that it was a public tender the chairman of our board had encouraged us to think about launching a complaint with the UK government agency in charge of such reviews.  We talked with lawyers.  We felt totally deflated.  We decided it wasn&#8217;t worth the fight.  We licked our wounds and moved on.</p>
<p>I am still not over that loss.  I sometimes call Stuart and we recount what happened.  But that loss was really important in my career.  It taught me a lot of lessons.  We spent enough time dissecting it to really learn.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Here are my take aways from the loss:</span></strong></p>
<p>1. In a sales campaign you always need to call as high as you can.  If you don&#8217;t, your competitors will.  If you don&#8217;t know them, somebody else does.  They may not overturn decision, but they sometimes do.</p>
<p>2. No deal is ever done until the ink is dry and the money is in your bank account.  Never take your win for granted.</p>
<p>3. You are most vulnerable right after it has been announced that you won (I will write a separate post on this). This is the most important lesson I learned from this experience.  All other lessons were sort of obvious.  This one was eye-opening.</p>
<p>4. We in the tech world extol the virtues of lots of product releases and rapid innovation.  I hear Silicon Valley firms bragging all the time about how often they release software.  In the consumer world, maybe.  In the corporate world this strategy is flawed.  Many large clients prefer stable technology and no changes &#8211; even sometimes when there are known security flaws.  When I was at Salesforce we launched a new version of our UI.  We gave users the choice to upgrade or keep with the classic UI.  Years later 10% of users were still on classic.  Go figure.</p>
<p>5. In every deal where you have serious competitors there is always somebody on the inside against you.  You need to find out who that is and neutralize them.</p>
<p>6. No matter how much your customer tells you that they love you and that they favor you it is possible they are telling other people the same thing or some variation of this.  (you would have thought I would have learned this lesson in high school <img src='http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>7. No matter how much large clients tell you they want transparency in pricing, they always seem to fall for the same old trick.  Competitors price low to get in the door and then nail them with scope control, change orders, product extension costs and other hidden items.  You can try to convince them of your &#8220;pay no more once you&#8217;ve signed up&#8221; model but they fall for the other guy&#8217;s pitch every time.  Low numbers are sexy.  I stopped trying to win this argument and chalk it up as some sort of human condition that I can&#8217;t change (like thinking that $14.99 = $14).</p>
<p>8. Time is the enemy of all deals.  If you have a chance to close something &#8211; don&#8217;t let it drift.</p>
<p>9. Losing sucks.  But at least it has made me a better competitor.</p>

<p><strong>I HATE LOSING</strong>. I hate it.  I really, really, really hate it.  It chaps my hide.  It rips at my core.  I don&#8217;t get over it easily.  I lose sleep.  I fucking hate losing.  It&#8217;s not so much the actual outcome that I hate &#8211; it&#8217;s the process.  The fact that I lost when I should have won.</p>
<p>I think about it for months, often years.  But I embrace losing.  It is how I learn.  I relive the moment so many times over in my mind wondering if I could have done this differently or if I shouldn&#8217;t have said or done this or that.  I talk to trusted sources about it.  I ask for feedback.  I hate losing.  I don&#8217;t want to lose next time.</p>
<p>I believe that it is part of the DNA of an entrepreneur &#8211; being so competitive that you&#8217;re practically sick when you lose.  It&#8217;s what makes you stand out from the rest.  Entrepreneurs are neurotic about it.  They&#8217;re competitive.  It&#8217;s the one thing I miss having switched from player to manager &#8211; I love the joy of winning and of competing.  It is never as rewarding when you&#8217;re the coach (but coaching has many other benefits <img src='http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; I&#8217;m not a sore loser.  I don&#8217;t break tennis rackets, cry foul, fall over like an Italian soccer player or work the referees.  Quite the opposite.  I&#8217;m usually quite a gracious loser.  I don&#8217;t hold grudges.  I move on.  I keep my competitors as friends and those that didn&#8217;t choose me or my product as friends, too.  But I never really get over it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking about garden-variety losses &#8211; that sort of loss I get over in a couple of days or weeks (but you don&#8217;t want to be around me that evening for sure).  I not even too bothered by the occasional deal that got away.  I&#8217;m talking about the hard fought battle.  The one that you thought you had.  The one you were counting on.  I&#8217;m talking Tom Watson at the British Open or Andy Roddick at Wimbledon.</p>
<p><strong>On Losing in VC</strong></p>
<p>Last year I lost a deal in a company that I wanted to invest in and that I thought I should have won.  I was angry &#8211; mostly at myself.  Rather than blame the team that I thought should have chosen me, I became reflective.  They were in LA and I was in LA.  They had a prominent NorCal investor already so I thought a SoCal lead would make sense &#8211; that I could help them in a more hands-on way.  They had agreed!</p>
<p>I had lost a previous deal where the team said they liked me but didn&#8217;t know my partners well enough so I promised myself never to let that happen again.</p>
<p>So I organized a team dinner with all four of my partners and all three of their founders.  I wanted to be sure that they knew how much all of our partners loved what they were doing with their company.  I wanted to be sure that they felt they knew all of my partners well so they could see why I joined up with them in the first place &#8211; they are smart guys who have a 20-year track record of winning.  15 companies North of $1 billion exit.  And they are normal, down-to-earth people as well.</p>
<p>After dinner on a Thursday night I thought we had the deal and that the team knew how hard I would work on their behalf if I were chosen.  By Monday morning after their board meeting in NorCal I didn&#8217;t get a return phone call.  I knew what this meant.  Good news always comes quickly, bad news takes time to simmer.  By the time I got through to the guys on Tuesday we had lost.</p>
<p>I knew that the, &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry&#8221; message was coming.  I embraced it with honor and didn&#8217;t give them a hard time.  But I obviously asked, &#8220;Why did it happen? I need to learn for next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were two main reasons that I could distill from their kind words of solace:  1) the existing NorCal investor didn&#8217;t know me well enough &amp; 2) the new NorCal investor had a good knowledge of and presence in China, which they believed would be critical.</p>
<p>I decided to put both of those issues to bed in 2010.  I came several times to NorCal (where I grew up, actually) and went and met several partners from each Silicon Valley firm.  I didn&#8217;t want this to happen again &#8211; that people didn&#8217;t know me.  I also made several trips to New York &amp; Boston.  Next year I&#8217;m going to spend time in Seattle and Boulder in addition.  I realized that it is not enough to know one partner per firm and it is not enough for only the management team to like you.  VCs have a seat at the table in deciding future investors.</p>
<p>I also spent two weeks in China and vowed to make it back frequently.  China is indelibly an important part of the future of the global technology system.  Although I had lived and worked in more than 10 countries &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t good enough. I didn&#8217;t know the one that mattered most to their future.  And for my own good I vowed to have relationships in China and knowledge of the local markets.  I&#8217;m not looking to invest there &#8211; I&#8217;m looking to understand the trends, the people, the innovation, the regions and how China can become an integral part of any of my portfolio companies as they scale.</p>
<p>I know I won&#8217;t win every deal I want to in VC.  There are other great VC&#8217;s in SoCal and there is always the allure of the NorCal guys flying down and talking about how they invested in Google, Facebook, Yahoo! or eBay.  But I will learn from any deals that I want to do and am not able to do.  I will embrace my losses.  May they be few and far between.  I can&#8217;t afford more sleepless nights.</p>
<p>This company is back on the market raising money again.  I love the area and the team as much now as I did a year ago &#8211; probably even more now that I know them better and have seen them perform.  I&#8217;m dropping everything non-portfolio related in the next few weeks and setting my sights on righting my wrong.  One great thing about losing is when you get a second chance.  I hope the next chapter will be written by the victor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Make sure you learn your lessons from losses.  Specifically:</span></strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright" title="lockerroom1_original185842" src="http://marksuster.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/lockerroom1_original185842.jpg?w=300" alt="lockerroom1_original185842" width="300" height="225" /><strong>1. Ask your customer why you lost.</strong> Tell them that you&#8217;d like to learn so that you can improve.  Promise you won&#8217;t be defensive or try to change the decision.  Best to ask after the dust from the decision has settled.  Ask multiple people involved with the decision.  Be gracious.  Write things down.</p>
<p><strong>2. Discuss with your team </strong>- do your post game analysis.  Don&#8217;t ignore your losses.  Don&#8217;t blame the people involved with the loss.  Don&#8217;t accept your internal team&#8217;s answer of why you lost &#8211; hear it for yourself.  Make sure that you hear all of your team&#8217;s perspective.  Draw your own independent conclusions &#8211; even if they are different from other people&#8217;s point of view.</p>
<p><strong>3. Triangulate. </strong> Who else was involved with the decision?  Were their consultants?  Can you discuss further down the line with your competitor?  Do you have friends on the inside?  The clearer picture you have of why you lost the more you&#8217;ll learn for next time.</p>
<p><strong>4. Learn.  And don&#8217;t make the same mistake twice</strong>.  Obvious, but I find that some people just never learn.  I read<a href="http://blog.precipice.org/why-wesabe-lost-to-mint" target="_blank"> this post from Marc Hedlund at Wesabe</a> on why they lost to Mint.  It&#8217;s one of my favorite blog posts.  I don&#8217;t know Marc but now I feel I want to work with him after reading this.  I had planned to blog about it at the time but I waited 2 days and the whole world blogged about it so I didn&#8217;t pile on.  If you never read it, please do.  It&#8217;s brilliant, reflective &amp; humble.  And I think he&#8217;s right that Mint never solved the problems the industry wanted to solve.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">A personal story of losing a sale that haunted me for years</span></strong></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-708" title="soccer loss" src="http://marksuster.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/soccer-loss.jpg?w=300" alt="soccer loss" width="300" height="193" /></p>
<p>In the 2003/04 timefame I was living in the UK and running my first company.  I had been competing to win a contract at Thames Water, the largest water company in the UK.  They were looking for a collaboration tool to manage all of their large water development projects.  The initial contract was worth about $500,000 and the whole value of the contract would have been worth a couple of million over the years.  I was working hand-in-hand with my close friend and associate <a href="http://blog.publicspend.com/publicspend/blog/">Stuart Lander</a> who was running our UK office and with one of our local sales reps.</p>
<p>We had initially been told that we had no chance because they had previously purchased Documentum and it would mean changing the system entirely.  They had a team trained up in Documentum and we certainly had enemies from the inside.  But we worked the account tirelessly for months.  We helped the write out their requirements for a system.  We met everybody in the organization.  We had every reference client we worked with call their senior team members (we had already won a major project at Scottish Water, Anglian Water and another at a large water company in Paris, France).</p>
<p>There were about 8 initial contenders for the work and in the end it came down to just 3 of us.  As the founder &amp; CEO I personally went and met with as many people at Thames Water as I could.  We felt this was a marquee account and one that would help us take our collaboration tool global as Thames owned assets all over the world.  Winning the contract meant that we would hit our quarterly revenue figure and be in good position for our annual sales target.</p>
<p>And then the news came.    A woman named Trish Hannon called me with the good news that we had won the project.  I was to tell noone until the contract was signed.  I immediately put a full team on contract management and another on drawing up an implementation plan.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-713" title="Defeat" src="http://marksuster.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/defeated-boxer.jpg?w=201" alt="Defeat" width="201" height="300" />I later learned one of my biggest lesson in sales.  You are most vulnerable right after you have won a deal.  It is when you&#8217;re competitors have nothing to lose.  It&#8217;s when the people who are part of the decision making process who don&#8217;t support the decision seek ways to undermine you.  That is when you potentially become complacent.</p>
<p>Two weeks after winning the deal and well into implementation planning we released a new version of our software.  We had made the decision that we would no longer be supporting IE v 5.5 (we would support 6.0 and 7.0, which was in beta).  Even Microsoft publicly said that there were security flaws with 5.5 and that people should upgrade.   But Thames Water was still on version 5.5.  We assumed they would take our advice and upgrade.  We had discussed this with Trish.</p>
<p>An internal resource inside Thames Water used our upgrade and lack of 5.5 support as a way to re-open the decision.  How could a company like ours be so callous as not to support their software (even one more than 4 years out of date)?  Did we really have good change management procedures if we were willing to launch products without backward compatibility. And so on.  They decided to re-open the competition for 3-4 more weeks.  I knew THEN that we had lost.  We fought hard to stay in the game.</p>
<p>They hired a consultant to help them with the review.  They stopped allowing us to contact them directly.  The momentum had shifted.  Something happened and it was clear to me that this IE issues was just a smoke screen.  Somebody had gotten to somebody senior in the Thames organization.  It just so happened that the consultant they hired to chose a software vendor worked for a company that had owned one of our competitors.  It was a tiny little collaboration company that only had a presence in the UK (and therefore couldn&#8217;t meet their international needs).   And surprise, surprise the decision came back 3 weeks later than none of the preferred 3 vendors had won but rather this tiny little competitor owned by the consulting company charged with doing the review.</p>
<p>Outrage.  Scandal.  Surely inside Thames they would see it for what it was.  Given that it was a public tender the chairman of our board had encouraged us to think about launching a complaint with the UK government agency in charge of such reviews.  We talked with lawyers.  We felt totally deflated.  We decided it wasn&#8217;t worth the fight.  We licked our wounds and moved on.</p>
<p>I am still not over that loss.  I sometimes call Stuart and we recount what happened.  But that loss was really important in my career.  It taught me a lot of lessons.  We spent enough time dissecting it to really learn.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Here are my take aways from the loss:</span></strong></p>
<p>1. In a sales campaign you always need to call as high as you can.  If you don&#8217;t, your competitors will.  If you don&#8217;t know them, somebody else does.  They may not overturn decision, but they sometimes do.</p>
<p>2. No deal is ever done until the ink is dry and the money is in your bank account.  Never take your win for granted.</p>
<p>3. You are most vulnerable right after it has been announced that you won (I will write a separate post on this). This is the most important lesson I learned from this experience.  All other lessons were sort of obvious.  This one was eye-opening.</p>
<p>4. We in the tech world extol the virtues of lots of product releases and rapid innovation.  I hear Silicon Valley firms bragging all the time about how often they release software.  In the consumer world, maybe.  In the corporate world this strategy is flawed.  Many large clients prefer stable technology and no changes &#8211; even sometimes when there are known security flaws.  When I was at Salesforce we launched a new version of our UI.  We gave users the choice to upgrade or keep with the classic UI.  Years later 10% of users were still on classic.  Go figure.</p>
<p>5. In every deal where you have serious competitors there is always somebody on the inside against you.  You need to find out who that is and neutralize them.</p>
<p>6. No matter how much your customer tells you that they love you and that they favor you it is possible they are telling other people the same thing or some variation of this.  (you would have thought I would have learned this lesson in high school <img src='http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>7. No matter how much large clients tell you they want transparency in pricing, they always seem to fall for the same old trick.  Competitors price low to get in the door and then nail them with scope control, change orders, product extension costs and other hidden items.  You can try to convince them of your &#8220;pay no more once you&#8217;ve signed up&#8221; model but they fall for the other guy&#8217;s pitch every time.  Low numbers are sexy.  I stopped trying to win this argument and chalk it up as some sort of human condition that I can&#8217;t change (like thinking that $14.99 = $14).</p>
<p>8. Time is the enemy of all deals.  If you have a chance to close something &#8211; don&#8217;t let it drift.</p>
<p>9. Losing sucks.  But at least it has made me a better competitor.</p>

<p>There is an error that I often see made on the other end of the spectrum.  Designing for simplicity doesn&#8217;t relieve you of the requirement to meet the needs of the power user.  These are the people, after all, who spend significant amounts of time using your product.</p>
<p>I have worked with several product teams over the years who have designed functionality that works really well for minimal usage &#8211; say where you do the task once or twice per day.  But there are many features that need to be used by a small portion of the user base in a super repetitive way.  To these power users often the initial use case is totally unusable.</p>
<p>So the opposite problem is when you over optimize a power feature for solely the novice and it becomes unusable for an iterative process (usually performed by a power user).  Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>At my first startup, we built a feature for creating project tasks.  We all know a thing or two about project management so they had a pretty good feel what they wanted to build.  They built in a bunch of really nice features like making the task-list embeddable in meeting notes so that you could show your output of a meeting including all of the tasks generated and if it was a &#8220;standing&#8221; meeting then it would print a list of tasks not yet completed by the next meeting.  It had the usual stuff like priorities, assignments, work effort level, etc.</p>
<p>And it worked brilliantly.  With one exception.  Our system was used on large scale engineering projects who had weekly or monthly meetings.  Each meeting generated hundreds of action items to be followed up on.  And it was usually one person from the meeting&#8217;s responsibility to input all of the actions into the system.  The best format for this person would have been a spreadsheet like input screen because 50 actions at a time might relate to one person or one company.  50 actions might be of a certain &#8220;type&#8221; and there may be 200 actions overall.</p>
<p>Our system only allowed you to create one action at a time so you had to go through an iterative process of create task, fill in details, assign task, save and then repeat.  Pretty dumb of us.</p>
<p>Ultimately we left the core functionality as it was.  We then added a small link that let you &#8220;create a major to-do list&#8221; or some similar wording.  That would send a more advanced user into a spreadsheet-like input screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this &#8220;error of iteration&#8221; occur many times in software designs.  One example is Quora.  I spoke in the design simplicity post about how it&#8217;s one of my favorite new products from a UX (and functionality!) perspective.  But they&#8217;re missing the design iteration concept.  They publish the &#8220;3 notifications&#8221; at a time in the top center of the screen.</p>
<p>This is great for the novice.  But for me it has become unusable.  For example, some days I&#8217;ll get 20-30 new followers.  Each time I need to open &#8220;items related to you&#8221; tab to see who these people are and choose which to follow.  When I click on &#8220;follow&#8221; one person the whole fracking thing closes and makes me do it all over again.  Sigh.</p>
<p>I encourage all product teams to ask to speak to the customer who would use your product repetitive, all day long and understand how they work.  While it might be an edge case, it is an important one.  Your &#8220;power users&#8221; will be either your most vocal supporters or the biggest pains in your arse.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fritzon/4711241023/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4131" title="ipad novice" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ipad-novice1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a>I&#8217;ve had a long-standing rule of thumb in product design, which I call &#8220;design for the novice, configure for the pro.&#8221;  I started saying this back in 2001/02, long before the era of Web 2.0, lean startups or even the advent of AJAX.</p>
<p>My philosophy emanated from my days of programming and later designing corporate software in the early 1990&#8242;s.  We were smart kids straight out of college and were designing the systems that we&#8217;d want to use.  We were young, computer literate and interested in learning about or playing with new technologies.</p>
<p>I watched us build systems for large corporations whose employees were in their 40&#8242;s / 50&#8242;s and who were primarily concerned with completing their business functions rapidly and with limited errors.  In designing GUI interfaces for people coming from the <a href="http://computer.yourdictionary.com/green-screen" target="_blank">green-screen</a> world we built applications that would be great for desktop publishing, not customer service reps.  We built in too many clicks, too many features, too many distractions.  We were confident we had improved things until we got to usability testing and watched with horror.</p>
<p>Fast forward a decade and now I had a startup filled with smart web developers.  I was 31 and they were in their 20&#8242;s.  Invariably they would build in too much functionality and assume that users were both familiar with and interested in having tons of choice.  My mantra back then was &#8220;what would your mom be able to use?&#8221;  Simplify, simplify, simplify.</p>
<p>Of course the debates raged about not wanting to make the system less powerful.  My view &#8211; power users always look at all of the menu options to figure out how to juice up the system.  You can always hide complexity into configuration screens rather than the out-of-the-box features.</p>
<p>Even in 2010 I think most companies err too much on the side of complexity.  They try to strike the right balance between making the base product &#8220;useful enough&#8221; for the &#8220;average&#8221; user.  I think the novice needs to be able to walk right in the door and be able to start playing around with your product &#8211; without a manual.  More difficult still, you need to be able to accomodate the &#8220;light&#8221; user who comes by once / month and barely remembers the application when the log in.</p>
<p>Obviously this doesn&#8217;t hold true for every application but it does for many.  And as much as we&#8217;d like to think otherwise, most people don&#8217;t really care about our company or our product &#8211; most people come by infrequently.  And if you can make life easier for these people then more of them will convert to become more frequent users.</p>
<p>I think one of the products that does this best in my mind is Gmail.  They do an incredible job of hiding most of their functionality yet allowing power users to soup things up if they want to.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you, it has been a while since I&#8217;ve actually done wireframes and designs but you never really lose the feel for what the right balance is to create a good UX.  It&#8217;s why when I used Quora I instantly felt like it was the most innovative UX I had seen in years.  It is beautiful in its simplicity (although I think I could give them a few tips to improve usability if they ever asked <img src='http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>
<p>So when some of the younger guys at startups I&#8217;ve funded start teasing me about my gray hair and that they&#8217;re now designing products for me (as opposed to their moms!) I say, &#8220;bring it on.&#8221;  I recently argued with a team for 6 months that they were intellectualizing their product too much and that the masses would want a simpler version.  They fought me for months and later admitted they needed to reduce the complexity of their product.  It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m smarter &#8211; it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve been through 10 more years of watching users play with products (and across many different tech stacks and form factors).</p>
<p>In summary, 2 quick rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do usability testing.  Watch people use your product with little or no instructions.  Give them tasks to complete without instructions of how to complete the tasks.  Film them.  Learn from them.  Many companies do this these days &#8211; not all do.  You MUST.  It is so instructive.  It will blow your mind away how people use products differently than you&#8217;d intend them to.  You&#8217;ll pull your hair out.  And in the end I&#8217;m quite sure that you&#8217;ll simplify things &#8211; not add things.</li>
<li>Design for the novice.  Configure fo the pro.  The pro will always find the advanced options.  This is easier said than done.  It&#8217;s always harder to build simple, yet usable products.  You become more defined as much by what you left out or simplified as by what you put in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll offer up design tip number 2: paying attention to iterative processes.</p>

Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve had 3-5 jobs in your career since college and for each job you list 5 key achievements.  If the recruiting manager&#8217;s job consisted solely of reviewing your resume it would be an easy task.  They&#8217;d read the whole thing and you&#8217;d look like the stellar candidate you know you are.  The reality is that they have hundreds of resumes on their desk so they apply filters and spend more time on those that get through the filter.  They look quickly for key facts such as where you worked, how long you were there, what role you played and maybe they&#8217;ll look for some key accomplishments.</p>
<p>So the problem is that if you have a few outstanding achievements they get lost in the sea of all the other shite you put in as fillers to make it look like you did a lot more.  Many people feel the need to tell the reader everything they worked on rather than the 3 biggest accomplishments.  I always advise people to only put the things that had the biggest impact to maximize the chance that they&#8217;ll actually be seen.  It follows the same rule as with comma&#8217;s, &#8220;<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/when_in_doubt_leave_it_out_tshirt-235979325347730227" target="_blank">when in doubt, leave it out</a>.&#8221;  <a href="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/When+in+Doubt,+Leave+It+Out" target="_blank">WIDLIO</a>.  That way the reader isn&#8217;t searching through a haystack to find your needles.</p>
<p><strong>VC Pitch Decks</strong><br />
My recommendation is to have an 8-12 slide decks with only the most critical factors of your business.  The great thing about the VC pitch deck is that you can have 30 slides.  The first 10 can be the &#8220;main event&#8221; and the next 20 can be listed behind a slide called &#8220;appendix.&#8221;  Investors don&#8217;t mind this &#8211; if they&#8217;re interested they&#8217;ll read more slides.  But the people who get 100+ decks / month can quickly get through yours and see whether there is a fit.</p>
<p>Each slide should be minimalist, more graphics and less text.  Where there is text it should be modeled after the resume (i.e. bullet points, shortened text, easy-to-read).  Often the bio slides have 3-5 people&#8217;s names on them followed by long paragraphs of their achievements.  If a VC only read your deck that would be fine but we&#8217;re no different than recruiters &#8211; we get more paperwork than we can process.  The easier you make it the more likely we&#8217;ll see &#8220;the good stuff.&#8221;  Less is more.</p>
<p><strong>Presentations</strong><br />
You&#8217;ve been given 10 minutes to stand on stage and tell what your company does and why it matters.  Too many people have 15-20 slides.  Do the math &#8211; you&#8217;ll never get through it all.  If you do, nobody will remember what you did.  The golden rule for slides is to assume 1-2 minutes per slide &#8211; and that is if you&#8217;re well practiced.  So if you have 10 minutes you should have 7-10 slides with huge graphics, limited text and large fonts.  Leave the audience wanting to learn more.  Make 3 big points and repeat them so that people can remember.  Give them the iPod not Microsoft Office products.  Less is more.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis / Conclusions</strong><br />
One of the most common tasks of &#8220;knowledge workers&#8221; is to analyze a situation and present conclusions to others in order to make decisions on a project.  Throughout my career I&#8217;ve produced hundreds of these reports.  In order to improve the efficacy of my reports I often would write an &#8220;executive summary&#8221; as the start that would have one paragraph describing the problem I was trying to solve, one paragraph talking through the options considered and one paragraph with my conclusion.</p>
<p>I would then have as many pages of analysis as required to show the detailes of my review.  But I knew that the busiest people often wanted to know the answer up front and to probe into the details if they were concerned with how we got to an answer.  I never wanted to &#8220;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bury_the_lead" target="_blank">bury the lead</a>.&#8221;  For the senior executives reading my reports, less was more.  They often wanted the answer quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Products</strong><br />
One of the great developments over the past five years has been the simplification of software.  We spend the previous 15 years with annual releases of bloatware.  Apple has shown us the way.  If you can pick up a product and use it with no manual it is well designed.  And nobody <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=RTFM" target="_blank">RTFM&#8217;s</a>.  Palm did a great job before Apple and before they had a brain fart and didn&#8217;t realize that people wanted email on their PDA&#8217;s &#8211; ceding the market to Blackberry (who in turn somehow haven&#8217;t figured out how to do a browser in the 4 years since Apple launched the iPhone).</p>
<p>I review many products every week.  I&#8217;d say I see way more products with too many features / too much complexity than I do ones with not enough.  I&#8217;m going to write a post soon with my personal product design philosophy, &#8220;design for the novice, configure for the pro.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
There are so many instances in the business world where less is more that I&#8217;d encourage you to always ask yourself whether this might actually be the case in your situation.  This includes emails, phone calls, elevator pitches, presentations, products, resumes, training manuals, you name it.  I can&#8217;t say it always applies but more than you&#8217;d imagine.  Remember the adage: when in doubt, leave it out.</p>
<p><strong>A Word on Hypocrisy </strong><br />
Wait a second.  You&#8217;re telling us that less is more? You, the king of the overly long blog posts?</p>
<p>Ha. Yes.  I think my blog posts would be far better if I made them 50% of the length.  The problem is that often less takes longer than more.  It&#8217;s the irony of less.  Less is more powerful but it&#8217;s often harder to produce.  I made a decision in blogging that I wanted to opt for frequency and depth of thought.  If I took the time to write less I would produce 50% of the content.</p>
<p>The normal process for me is sit at my computer for an hour (usually at 10pm), crank out a quick post, spell check, find an image and hit publish.  Often the next day I&#8217;ll edit it 10% at the margin when I re-read it and find errors.</p>
<p>I opt for more because in the case of my blog &#8211; less would take too much effort.  In other activities I actually put in a lot of effort to deliver higher quality outputs with less.</p>

<p>I had breakfast with <a href="http://twitter.com/davetisch" target="_blank">David Tisch</a> the other morning in NYC.  If you don&#8217;t know David he&#8217;s the guy who will be running <a href="http://www.techstars.org/nyc/" target="_blank">TechStars New York</a> starting in January.  And that&#8217;s a great thing because I was really impressed with him.  Surprisingly so.</p>
<p>He had a ton of great ideas about what he wanted to do with TechStars NY.  I&#8217;ve agreed to come out in the new year and spend a few days with the entrepreneurs who join TechStars NYC (as well as Boulder).  I love this program.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running Launchpad LA (very similar to TechStars) for 2 years but I must say I had some great take-aways at breakfast from David who hasn&#8217;t even run his first group yet!  I&#8217;m always impressed when people are wise beyond their years and felt like David was a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>One of the things we were chatting about was how many first-time entrepreneurs have grown up digital natives so have a really good intuitive feel for technology &amp; design but don&#8217;t yet have the business basics down.  This shows itself when people try to do an elevator pitch, send concise, actionable emails or have a quick phone call with you to ask for help.  David said he wants to be sure his class is grounded in the business basics that will help with success &#8211; this is smart and I plan to copy him.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.feld.com" target="_blank">Brad Feld</a> told me that TechStars makes each company practice the 1 or 2-minute pitch the first week of the program.  Whenever somebody visits a TechStars office they go around and meet the companies and hear these pitches.  It gets drilled into each founder the need to have a pithy overview of their business and why it&#8217;s relevant.  Smart.  It&#8217;s one of the most common activities of an entrepreneur used in recruiting, marketing, sales, networking, biz dev, etc.  I plan to do this with the next Launchpad LA class.  If you haven&#8217;t read about <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/08/15/i-buy-dead-magazines-the-art-of-the-intro/" target="_blank">Sam Jones and &#8220;dead magazines&#8221;</a> it&#8217;s worth your time to have a quick read.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.2px;">So I thought I&#8217;d blog about one of the topics we discussed at breakfast &#8211; the phone call.  I&#8217;m not talking about a sales call, getting past the assistant or anything like that. I&#8217;m talking about simple and quick calls to your business peers, VCs or other players in your ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><strong>How Can I Help?</strong></p>
<p>Angels, entrepreneurs, VCs, bloggers and the like all get a ton of requests for &#8220;just 15 minutes&#8221; phone calls.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m OK with this.  One of the more rewarding parts of my job is being able to help other people.  It&#8217;s high in the gratification quadrant when somebody comes back and says that our chat made a difference in their business.</p>
<p>The truth is I think that it&#8217;s part of human nature to want to try and help others so you&#8217;d be surprised how many people will find ways to help if asked appropriately or by the right person.</p>
<p>So when a person calls me and we&#8217;re 10 minutes into the call and it&#8217;s not clear why they&#8217;re calling I&#8217;m usually thinking to myself, &#8220;what was the reason they wanted to call me in the first place?  What are they hoping to achieve?&#8221; and mostly, &#8220;How can I help?&#8221;</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t get to the point and since the distance between my random inner-head mutterings and my mouth are too small and my ADHD too great, it often just blurts out of me like Tourette&#8217;s syndrome, &#8220;Let me just stop you there.  How can I best help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what we want.  It&#8217;s what you want.  Let&#8217;s be explicit about it.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my advice:</p>
<p><strong>1. You can start informally with banter </strong>- If I&#8217;m calling somebody I know a bit I usually try to start with a little friendly banter.  If I know they like a sports team that might be a good start.  If I saw their company in the press, heard that they saw somebody at an event that I know, they live in a town where a storm just rolled through &#8211; whatever.  I think trying to humanize the call from the outset is good.  When you jump straight into &#8220;sales pitch mode&#8221; it feels a bit strange.</p>
<p>Two things to watch for: 1) if you&#8217;re trying banter to build rapport but not &#8220;feeling it&#8221; then quickly shift to business.  Some people just aren&#8217;t &#8220;chit chatters&#8221; and prefer to get on with things. I find that kinda boring, but I know some people are just wired that way.  2) some callers take this banter too far  It starts to border on disrespectful of the person&#8217;s time or wasteful of your 15 minutes.  Don&#8217;t be that person.</p>
<p>How long you go for is really a judgment call because there&#8217;s no right answer.  If it&#8217;s somebody that I know really well and I confirm that they&#8217;re not rushing to do something else I might even take 10-15 minutes just to &#8220;catch up.&#8221;  If it&#8217;s a general acquaintance it&#8217;s probably more like 3-4 minutes.  If it&#8217;s a first time call you might try to keep it at 2 minutes or less.</p>
<p>So even if the person you called is really chatty don&#8217;t be undisciplined and let them talk too long.  You have limited time on the call, presumably you called for a reason and you&#8217;re chewing up your valuable clock.</p>
<p><strong>2. Let them know why you&#8217;re calling</strong> - When you&#8217;re ready to pivot the conversation your next line should be some derivative of, &#8220;listen, the reason I&#8217;m calling is &#8230; blah, blah, blah&#8221;  25% of people or less actually do this.  They just talk and I&#8217;m not really sure why they called.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re calling for a reason, the sooner the recipient knows the sooner they can help.  If the clock runs out they&#8217;re not going to be able to help.  Even if you don&#8217;t have a single &#8220;ask&#8221; I recommend saying something like, &#8220;listen, I&#8217;m going to make this call short.  I don&#8217;t have anything I&#8217;m asking for, I was just hoping to get 10 minutes of your time to tell you what we&#8217;re up to so that the next chance we get to meet down the line you&#8217;ve got more of an understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Don&#8217;t hang yourself</strong> &#8211; One of the other big mistakes callers make is going &#8220;off to the races&#8221; talking about their business without getting any feedback from the recipient of the call.  This is bad enough in person but I promise you if you do it over the phone the recipient will start to tune out.  If you listen closely you&#8217;ll probably even hear the tapping of a keyboard.  You can talk for a bit but then seek feedback and make sure the other person is &#8220;with you.&#8221;  When I used to do a lot of recruiting we used to call it &#8220;hanging yourself&#8221; because people who talk for long periods of time without seeking feedback are generally not self-aware or good at human interaction.  Don&#8217;t be that person.</p>
<p><strong>4. Ask questions</strong> &#8211; The best trick for creating a two-way conversation is to ask questions.  You can do this too early in the call and you can&#8217;t be an interview factory, but polite questions relevant to your topic are appropriate.  It will help ensure that you don&#8217;t do all the talking.  Plus, when you listen you learn more anyways.</p>
<p><strong>5. Know what &#8220;the ask&#8221; is</strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;re set up a call with somebody then know in advance why you&#8217;re calling and what you plan to ask for.  Don&#8217;t ask for four things or you&#8217;ll get none.  Don&#8217;t ask for big favors unless you have a tight relationship.  Don&#8217;t assume that this will be the one and only time you&#8217;ll ever talk to the person.  If you cultivate a good long-term relationship through patience, persistence and reciprocity there will be many more occasions.  So by all means have an &#8220;ask&#8221; but make it: obvious, easy for them to achieve and of a limited number &#8211; preferably one.</p>
<p><strong>6. Stick to your budgeted time &#8211; maybe less</strong> &#8211; When you think of your relationship with the individual as a relationship you&#8217;ll build over time and over many calls, discussions, chats at conferences or whatever you&#8217;ll realize you need to be known for being respectful of other&#8217;s time.  If you&#8217;re known as the person who&#8217;s always long winded you&#8217;re less likely to get the next few calls on the calendar.  Less is better, I promise.</p>
<p>Now go pick up the phone and stop hiding behind emails.  You build real relationships on the phone and in person.  Good luck.</p>

<p>What that means is that in a typical week I might see 10-15 new company pitches.  Sometimes more.  I speak at conferences where I might meet 75-100 people and have conversations.  I do dinners too often as my waistline can attest.  I have long one-on-one conversations with people for hours.</p>
<p>I have Twitter chats, respond to blog comments, trade emails, respond to comments on This Week in VC.</p>
<p>You get the picture.</p>
<p>I actually do have a very good memory.  People are often surprised at the small details I sometimes remember from our initial meetings.  Little tidbits, random facts.  I&#8217;m especially good with numbers &#8211; for some reason that&#8217;s how my brain is wired.  I&#8217;m less good at names.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the thing.  When I see you I&#8217;m probably thinking, &#8220;damn, I know that person.  How do I know them?  How do I know them?  How do I know them?&#8221;  Sometimes this happens even with people I&#8217;ve met several times if I see them out of context (i.e. where I wasn&#8217;t expecting to bump into them).</p>
<p>All I need is a little context.  &#8221;Mark, we met last year at the NYU event.  I spoke briefly to you about my startup in the x,y,z space.  I was formerly at the AP as an international journalist before coming to Stanford to get my masters.&#8221;</p>
<p>BOOM!  I remember!  &#8221;You&#8217;re the guy who built the Twitter plug-in for blogs.  Yeah!  I remember.  I thought that was a cool idea.  So what&#8217;s the latest?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if for some reason it slips my brain the context ALWAYS helps.  I know it sounds dumb.  That you could sit in somebody&#8217;s office for an hour and they don&#8217;t instantly remember you even though you had a big chat.  Or even somebody that I had breakfast with!  I do remember these meetings.  I PROMISE I remember them &#8211; I just need the context.</p>
<p>And if I&#8217;m like this, I&#8217;m pretty sure other high-volume people are, too.  And many of the people you want to interact with (VCs, Micro VCs, angels, biz dev teams, corp dev teams, CEOs, journalists &#8230; they are ALL high volume people).  Just remember to give them a little prompt.  Even if you&#8217;re pretty sure they know you it never hurts to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>It will save them from trolling the depths of their mental database trying to place you while you&#8217;re speaking.  And if it&#8217;s me and the lightbulb doesn&#8217;t instantly go off &#8211; please don&#8217;t be offended.  I promise once I have access to my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory" target="_blank">ROM</a> memory I&#8217;ll click into gear.  If only I was a newer model wired with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" target="_blank">SSD</a>.  Alas.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">In normal times investors will look for &#8220;traction&#8221; before investing.  We want to make sure we&#8217;re in love.  This sometimes frustrates entrepreneurs who just want to &#8220;get back to running the business.&#8221;  But if you understand it you&#8217;ll see that it is perfectly rational and it should also influence how you form relationships with investors.  And remember, if we get married you&#8217;re stuck with us, too.<a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/investing-in-dots.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4066" title="investing in dots" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/investing-in-dots.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="263" /></a>The first time I meet you, you are a single data point.  A dot.  I have no reference point from which to judge whether you were higher on the y-axis 3 months ago or lower.  Because I have no observation points from the past, I have no sense for where you will be in the future.  Thus, it is very hard to make a commitment to fund you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For this reason I tell entrepreneurs the following: Meet your potential investors early.  Tell them you&#8217;re not raising money yet but that you will be in the next 6 months or so.  Tell them you really like them so you want them to have an early view (which is what all investor&#8217;s want).  When you&#8217;re with them lower the bar by telling them, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t shipped product yet, we have lots of decisions still to make, but we&#8217;d like to show you our prototype&#8221; or obviously if you&#8217;re more advanced show what you have and what your roadmap looks like.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most importantly tell them what you plan to achieve by the next time you see them.  Hopefully by then you&#8217;ve made good progress.  You&#8217;ll be able to give them an update on key hires, pilot customers, key tech innovations &#8211; whatever.  Keep these interactions low-key and short.  Quick coffees, whatever.  Swing by their offices to make it easy for them to say yes and promise not to take up more than 30 minutes for the update (and stick to it).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I spoke about this more in depth in these two posts: <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/10/06/the-four-main-things-that-investors-look-for-in-a-startup/" target="_blank">4 things I look for in an investment</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/08/08/wtf-is-traction-a-6-step-relationship-guide-to-vc/" target="_blank">how to manage VC relationships</a>.  And don&#8217;t allocate two months of each year to &#8220;hardcore funding activities&#8221; but allocate a regular amount of time each month to it like any other job function.  Like it or not &#8211; finance is a major job function in any company &#8211; startup or public company.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lines.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4072" title="lines" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/lines.jpg" alt="" width="419" height="266" /></a>The thing is, by the time I get to know you I start to see patterns.  Note that &#8220;performance&#8221; on my chart is a loose term for my definition of perceived progress that can take the form of product, customer adoption, employees, investors, press or whatever.  It is basically a perception that you are making progress in your business and not standing still.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All of these meetings don&#8217;t actually require you to prove that you&#8217;re &#8220;killing it&#8221; over night.  It&#8217;s a chance for us to build a relationship and for the investor to see how you think and how you respond to adversity.  How can you prove <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/12/15/what-makes-an-entrepreneur-111-tenacity/" target="_blank">tenacity</a>, <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/12/18/what-makes-an-entrepreneur-410-resiliency/" target="_blank">resiliency</a> or <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/12/17/what-makes-an-entrepreneur-310-ability-to-pivot/" target="_blank">ability to pivot</a> in a single data point?  I funded <a href="http://ad.ly/" target="_blank">Ad.ly</a> having seen Sean Rad perform over a 1-year period at Orgoo, which didn&#8217;t succeed.  I didn&#8217;t invest in Orgoo but by the time he launched Ad.ly I knew his capabilities and knew I wanted to work with him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I had 15 meetings or more with Evan Rifkin over a 2-year period of time long before I invested in <a href="http://www.burstly.com/" target="_blank">Burstly</a>. In fact, long before he had even founded Burstly.  I knew he was one of the most talented entrepreneurs in LA and he has exceeded my expectations since I invested.  Presumably during this interactions Evan also decided I wasn&#8217;t a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;source=imghp&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=644&amp;q=dick+cheney&amp;gbv=2&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=" target="_blank">Dick</a> so the meetings cut both ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I spent the past week in New York.  The profile of one of the hottest companies I met was as per the graph below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hot-deal-in-nyc.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4077" title="hot deal in nyc" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/hot-deal-in-nyc.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="274" /></a>The deal is moving a bit too fast for me and is becoming frenzied with interest.  But I really think this company has a good shot at becoming a monster.  It&#8217;s a killer CEO, great product, market ripe for disruption, experienced product team and great CMO who has relevant experience from her former life.  I&#8217;ve been watching from the sidelines for 6 months and waiting to meet the team.  Given a few more data points I would have liked to have invested but given the market speed it looks unlikely.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>So here&#8217;s the thing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investors</strong> &#8211; The market is moving uber fast on deals.  Investors are writing checks for dots.  This is happening with both angels and VCs.  If you invest in dots don&#8217;t be surprised when the trend isn&#8217;t in the direction you would have hoped.  Pattern recognition requires a pattern.  <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2010/11/14/what-angel-investing-florida-condos-have-in-common/" target="_blank">Dots produce bubbles</a>.  And some argue that <a href="http://twitter.com/danielleahy/status/4409502543650816" target="_blank">bubbles have positive externalities for entrepreneurs </a>- maybe.  But many bubbles wreak more havoc than positive effects.  And those of us who have lived through the past 2 funding bubbles saw all this at close range.  And many I&#8217;m having the debate with are on their first time around.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lines vs. Dots &#8211; </strong>Over on HackerNews somebody cleverly wrote, <em>&#8220;Surely someone will invest in the &#8216;dot&#8217; and he&#8217;ll miss the chance. He seems to assume there is no competition. Or maybe what is a dot to him was already a line to someone else (because they met earlier)&#8221; &#8211; </em>this is my point exactly.  If you&#8217;re an investor looking at dots somebody else may be looking at lines.  Meet entrepreneurs early and watch how they perform &#8211; maybe even at their previous startup.  I always ask to meet people before they&#8217;re officially fund raising &#8211; well before actually.  It helps me spot patterns.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurs</strong> &#8211; you might be pumped up with that super quick round done at a high price.  But just remember that raising money is a bit like Ireland in the 90&#8242;s &#8211; no divorces allowed.  I know VCs and sophisticated angels can be difficult, slow and price sensitive, but I also know that in tough times unsophisticated investors can be a right pain in the arse.  For some companies &#8211; they become deal breakers on further funding rounds.  By definition if somebody is investing in you as a dot (limited thought, limited due diligence, maximum price) they are a dot to you, too.  You can&#8217;t really know them in 2 minutes yet you&#8217;re letting them own part of your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUrMcmQClU8" target="_blank">we all know how Vegas weddings turn out</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really hard to zig when the whole world seems to be zagging.  One of my favorite quotes I learned in high school was:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Nonconformity is the Highest Form of Social Attainment&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It was written as the yearbook quote of the smartest seniors as I was finishing my freshman year.  It has always stood with me.  I have had a low bullshit meter.  I remember it even way back in kindergarden when my Saturday school teacher tried to tell me about Noah and Adam &amp; Eve.  Those stories didn&#8217;t sound that plausible to me.  Much to her chagrin, the other slogan I have always lived by is</p>
<blockquote><p><em> &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Authority" target="_blank">Question Authority</a>.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the masses start all running one way without questioning &#8220;why?&#8221; &#8211; and when it defies any logic I can figure out in my head &#8211; I call bullshit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And so it happened that between 2000-2008 I was the biggest buzz kill at dinner parties.  While many of my friends bragged about their 5 condos in Florida I kept talking about how the real estate market was in a bubble &#8211; their gains an illusion.  I pointed to several Economist articles I had read that mapped historical prices of real estate for 400 years and how on average property values grow at no more 1.5% above inflation yet in many markets in the US &amp; Europe prices were rising at 10-25% per year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>&#8220;Yeah, but there is a shortage of supply.  People always want to buy near the water and there is limited supply.  The fundamentals are different now!  You&#8217;re stuck in the past.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ahem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The price of property has an inherent value tied to two factors: 1) the rental rate you could charge for your property and 2) annual salaries in a given geography.  For reason number two people pay a higher price &amp; rent in New York than they do in San Antonio, Texas.  Yes, there are some factors that can affect property prices beyond these two factors (e.g. a high portion of vacation homes or a market changes in demographics such as age) but income (and the employment rate) has the highest correlation in most markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At dinner parties I was wrong for several years but I stuck to my guns.  The numbers just didn&#8217;t make sense to me.  I kept pointing to the artificial gains in the Nasdaq in 1999 and said, &#8220;just because you bought in Feb &#8217;99 and sold in Sept &#8217;99 for a large gain doesn&#8217;t meant the asset was correctly priced.&#8221;  My message to everybody at the time, &#8220;Sell!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And so Buzzkill Suster continues.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The dinner parties now are filled with self-righteous angel investors bragging about how many deals they are in on.  They have marked-up paper gains propped up by an over excited venture capital market that has validated their investments.  For now.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Logic tells me the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is hard to make money angel investing.</strong> I have called it a &#8220;mug&#8217;s game&#8221; and I mostly try to avoid it.  The best angels will do very well just at the best real estate investors did well in good times and bad.  But the masses have now entered the market and everybody fancies themselves an &#8220;angel investor.&#8221;  It is the new calling card.  It is the new cocktail party conversation.  We list it on our bio&#8217;s as bragging rights.  We jockey to make sure the press release has our names on it.  It is slowly becoming Florida Condos.  And it&#8217;s driving up prices beyond their inherent value.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are too many deals</strong>.   For venture capitalists this isn&#8217;t troubling.  Too many angel deals just means more to watch and invest in for the ones that do succeed (if the VCs can get in at reasonable prices).  But all of this increased company creation has to go somewhere.  Arguement one says, &#8220;the world is different now.  It costs less money to start companies so the world should have way more startups.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve heard the &#8220;world is different&#8221; argument in every bubble I&#8217;ve ever seen.  It&#8217;s true that it&#8217;s cheaper to start companies now and cheaper to get distribution.  Most of these companies will not get big enough and earn enough profits to pay big enough salaries for teams.  People only put up with &#8220;ramen profitable&#8221; salaries for so long before they become disenchanted.  Argument two says, &#8220;big companies can&#8217;t innovate anymore so Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc. will continue to buy up this talent as a form of R&amp;D.&#8221;  That is true &#8211; in a booming market like we&#8217;re seeing now.  Remember it was only 2008 where Microsoft and even Google were laying off employees.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many may simply hit the wall.</strong> If the &#8220;forever ramen profitable&#8221; or &#8220;startups as a source of M&amp;A innovation&#8221; arguments don&#8217;t hold then we&#8217;re likely headed for one big brick wall.  That would mean that the increased number of new business startups will lead to a &#8220;funding gap&#8221; of deals that can&#8217;t get financed.  We haven&#8217;t hit that wall yet for three reasons: 1) not enough elapsed time, 2) the VC market is frenzied now, too and 3) we haven&#8217;t seen a market downturn since the volume picked up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great businesses take 7-10 years to build. </strong> People often talk about what makes a great investor.  I always say, &#8220;if you&#8217;re judging actual returns on a 3-year timeframe you&#8217;re looking at mostly failure.  This is the time it takes for a bankruptcy or asset sale to occur.  Or a quick flip.  Any of these scenarios aren&#8217;t great outcomes for investors.&#8221;  The reality is that the &#8220;big winners&#8221; in business that drive extra-ordinary returns often take 7-10 years to materialize.  <a href="http://twitter.com/danmunro" target="_blank">Dan Munro</a> linked to t<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2009/08/25/how-long-does-it-take-to-build-a-technology-empire/" target="_blank">his excellent article in the WSJ</a> in the comments with real data to prove the point.  The problem is that this is longer than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Businesscycle_figure3.jpg" target="_blank">average economic cycle</a>, which means you need to be able to manage in good times and bad.  Bad times often require more capital but ironically this is when capital is dried up.  Bad times are when M&amp;A halts to a trickle and this is when many businesses are rushing to get exits.  If I judge the success of the &#8220;angel boom&#8221; by the last 18 months it is a resounding success &#8211; at least on paper. But I&#8217;ll judge the angel class of 2009/2010 on a 7-10 year time horizon.  We&#8217;ll re-compare notes then.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investors are conformists by nature</strong>.  I believe that huge financial, productivity and technical gains come from new innovation rather than derivative thinking.  This requires novel thinking.  Yet nearly any entrepreneur who has an idea that other people aren&#8217;t doing will tell you that it&#8217;s hard to get investors excited.  Instead investors are looking for the next flash sale, private sale, game dynamic, social games that rely on mobile platforms with geo-fenced, location aware offers.  That is conformity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>People buy at the wrong times.</strong> Most of my <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2009/09/08/are-mbas-necessary-for-start-ups-or-vc/" target="_blank">MBA classes were a waste</a> (since I had studied economics as an undergrad) but one totally changed my thinking.  It was an investment management class.  The professor showed that there is a big increase in volume of buyers as a market peaks and a big increase in selling as the market is falling.  He said that data suggests people prefer to &#8220;buy high, sell low.&#8221;  And so it goes in tech investing.  I saw VCs doing crazy things in 2007-08 when I first entered the VC market &#8211; crazy prices, limited due diligence, large funding rounds.  I avoided much of this.  in 2009 the market was completely constipated as investors focused on triage.  I was very active in 2009 / early 2010.  The market is <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/11/storm-clouds.html" target="_blank">over-heating again</a> with people chasing deal.  It&#8217;s like &#8220;market amnesia.&#8221;  I must also say that all those angels who hid their checkbooks in 2008/09 are now back with a vengeance and paying higher &amp; higher prices.  Same with VCs.  And now everybody is an angel.  Even people who haven&#8217;t had good exits, gained experience in their careers or have enough deep pockets to last a market downturn fancy themselves as angels.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>I&#8217;m skating where I think the puck is going</strong>.  I&#8217;m not giving up on the market completely.  I am avoiding &#8220;frenzied&#8221; deals for all of the reasons <a href="http://twitter.com/infoarbitrage" target="_blank">Roger Ehrenberg</a> talks about in <a href="http://informationarbitrage.com/post/1552977090/investing-in-a-frenzied-market" target="_blank">his excellent blog post</a>.  I&#8217;m trying to pick themes that I think will map to macro trends over the next 5-10 years.  I&#8217;m spending a lot of time looking at video production &amp; distribution because I believe this will form a larger basis of the future Internet and I believe that Hollywood &amp; television will face large, disruptive forces.  Plus, as I live in Los Angeles it is where some of the smartest talent thinking about this space resides.  I&#8217;m looking at how the digital living room will change media consumption.  I continue to be excited about the Mobile Web (as distinct from the Mobile App).  I still love B2B application.  I am really bullish on data-as-a-service.  I will write about some of these topics soon.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why should you care? </strong></p>
<p>If you raise money from experienced sources &#8211; whether angel, micro-VC or VC &#8211; you will be better served in scenarios when the market corrects, where your large competitors launch hostile offerings or where things end up taking longer than you had expected in order to show progress.  Mine is not an argument for VCs over angels &#8211; it is for sophistication over <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/credulity" target="_blank">credulity</a>.   In boom times anybody&#8217;s money will do.  I&#8217;ve lived through two tech market corrections at close range.  The first money to pack-up and head for the door is always the least knowledgeable / least committed to the long-term of our industry.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3968" title="blank name tag" src="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/blank-name-tag.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="339" /></p>
<p>It OUGHT to be really obvious how to create a proper tag for a conference, but my observation is that 98% of conferences suck at name tags.  Maybe more.  It makes networking much more difficult / awkward.  And it&#8217;s so damn solvable &#8211; no rocket science degree required.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It completely baffles me, actually.  I would think these suggestions would be a BGO (blinding glimpse of the obvious, for those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-letter_acronym" target="_blank">TLA</a> fans) but I guess not.  If you agree with me, please forward this post to people organizing conferences to save us all the future hassle.</p>
<p><strong>1. If you can, avoid &#8220;hanging&#8221; name tags </strong>- I&#8217;m not a big fan of name tags that hang from your neck.  One reason is that the length is hard to estimate and therefore the tags usually end up somewhere close to your belly.  It is really impractical to try and glance at somebody&#8217;s name / company when it&#8217;s by their belly.  It&#8217;s even more embarrassing if you&#8217;re already supposed to know the person and you&#8217;re looking for a prompt to remember their name or when you&#8217;re trying to figure out the name of a woman.  Bit awkward, hey?</p>
<p>My preference is to have a name tag that has a magnetic device so that each person can attach it to their shirt, blouse, lapel or wherever they want it.  But I guarantee the people will place it higher than the hanging name tag and thus readable.</p>
<p><strong>2. If you have hanging name tags make them two sided </strong>- The magnetic name tags are more expensive so I know some people won&#8217;t opt for them.  If you DO go for hanging name tags, for fuck sake print the names on both sides of the tag.  It seems a universal law that these tags flip over and more than 50% of the time seem not to land on the side with the name.  It&#8217;s so easy to just print two-sided.  If you&#8217;re going to bother having name tags, you want people to read them.  Let&#8217;s just call it &#8220;BothSidesoftheTag.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>3. Make the name big. Really big</strong>. &#8211; And another thing (I&#8217;m feeling a bit like Larry David right now &#8230;) why do people print out name tags and then make the names in a really small font so only 16 year olds can read them?  Names ought to take almost 50% of the space on the name tag.  The whole point is to be able to READ the name tag.  In the same way you don&#8217;t want people to present at a conference with 12 point fonts, why do you print out their name tags with similar sizes?  Go big!</p>
<p><strong>4. Make the company name just as big</strong>. &#8211; And while you&#8217;re at it, make the other 50% say their company name.   Those are the two things every single person who is networking at your event wants to know &#8211; name &amp; company.  Make all of our lives easier.  My personal suggestion is to make the company name a slightly different color so it&#8217;s easier on the eye to distinguish.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don&#8217;t waste space with meaningless information </strong>- I know you want to put your event name really big on the tag.  I understand that urge.  But we&#8217;re already AT your event.  We know it&#8217;s your event.  We chose to come.  We love you already.  Your big logo / name / event description on the name tag is taking away from its functional utility.  It is distracting.  It steals space from the main event.  And we&#8217;re not going to save it as a keepsake after the event, so why bother?  If you must put it, please consider putting it at the bottom and in really small writing.</p>
<p><strong>6. Don&#8217;t have name tags we need to pin to ourselves </strong>- Very few people have these kinds of tags any more.  That&#8217;s great.  This is the worst kind of tag overall for obvious reasons.  It ruins people&#8217;s clothes.  Obvious.</p>
<p><strong>7. Have a thick pen handy </strong>- Finally, there will always be somebody that somehow got left off your list or is conference crashing (i.e. the kind you&#8217;re OK with being there).  Nothing worse than being the only person at a conference with no name tag.</p>
<p><strong>8. Oh, and &#8230;</strong> &#8211; I was prompted by Al in the comments.  We don&#8217;t need all that extra VIP junk where you say if we&#8217;re a speaker, moderator or sponsor on our name tags.  It doesn&#8217;t really make us feel extra special.  It&#8217;s just a distraction.</p>
<p>End of rant.  Get back to work.</p>
