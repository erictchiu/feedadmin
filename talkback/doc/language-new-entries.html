		<strong>TalkBack User Guide<br />Adding entries to the language file</strong><br />

	<p>You can add your own entries to the language file. You might do this, for example, if you are using multiple language files and want to create a customized comments template. In such a case you have multiple languages but can only put text directly into the template for one language. An example that comes to mind is a greeting in a guestbook. </p>

		<blockquote>It is always nice to hear from people that have visited so leave a comment, 
ask a question or just say hi.</blockquote>
		
		Normally you would place such text in your html file above the TalkBack include. Example:
		<pre>&lt;p&gt;It is always nice to hear from people that have visited so leave a comment, 
ask a question or just say hi.&lt;/p&gt;
			
&lt;?php require 'talkback/comments.php'; ?&gt;
		</pre>

		<p>That works fine for users that have a single language site. But if your site is multi-language, the greeting is not translated because it is (1) not in the language file and (2) not inside the comments template. Read on to learn how you can rectify that.</p>

		<p>First, add your greeting to each override language file (e.g. my-english.php and my-dutch.php). Create an entry using an entry name that won&rsquo;t conflict with any other language file names. I suggest using the prefix &ldquo;my_&rdquo; (you can use underscores but not dashes in entry names). </p>

		<pre>$lang['my_greeting'] = "It is always nice to hear from people that have visited so leave a comment, ask a question or just say hi."</pre>
		
		<p>Then create a custom template by copying and renaming comments-display-tpl.php (e.g. my-comments-display-tpl.php). This prevents your changes from being overwritten if you upgrade to a new version of TalkBack. Add a new paragraph at the beginning of the template. Below is the beginning of the template, before you change it:</p>

		<pre>// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// Print the "Leave a comment" link
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
print "
&lt;div id='tb-wrapper'&gt;
   &lt;p id='tb-comment-link'&gt;&lt;a href='#tb-form-div'&gt;{$lang['comdisplay6']}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"; </pre>
	
	And here is the template after you insert your greeting paragraph:
	
	<pre>// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
// Print the "Leave a comment" link
// +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
print "
&lt;div id='tb-wrapper'&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;{$lang['my_greeting']}&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p id='tb-comment-link'&gt;&lt;a href='#tb-form-div'&gt;{$lang['comdisplay6']}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"; </pre>
	
	<p><code>{$lang['my_greeting']}</code> tells PHP to insert that entry from the language file into the output HTML. Note the beginning and ending braces. They are necessary, you will get a PHP error if you omit them. Where you place it in the template is up to you. You could also place it above the tb-wrapper div.</p>

	<p>Finally, instruct TalkBack to use the new template instead of the default template. Edit the filename for &ldquo;Comments display template&rdquo; via admin configuration maintenance.</p>
