<h2>The default language package</h2>
<p>As downloaded, TalkBack comes with the English language package. A language package consists of a <em>primary</em> language file, an <em>override</em> language file and a language icon (a flag GIF). Go to the TalkBack <a href='http://www.scripts.oldguy.us/talkback/download.php' target='_blank' class='xlink'>download page</a> for additional language packages.</p>

The <strong>primary</strong> language file in this language pack is <code>language/english.php</code>. 

<p>The  <strong>override</strong> language file in this language pack is <code>my-english.php</code>. It allows you to customize individual language entries without fear of your changes being overwritten in a future release.</p>

<a name='contents'></a>
<h2>Language file contents</h2>
<p>The file contains the text entries for all labels, messages and help panels. It is a large file with over 800 entries (70kb) as of version 2.2. Each <em>entry</em> in the file is an element of the language array and is formatted like this:<br /><br />
<code>$lang['comdisplay2'] = "There is 1 comment";</code></p>

<p>The entry&rsquo;s name is contained inside the single quotes inside the brackets. The entry&rsquo;s text is contained between the double quotes. Some of the entries contain html tags and/or PHP variables:</p>

<pre>$lang['db_error'] = "&lt;p class='tb-center tb-stress'&gt;Comments for this page are temporarily unavailable&lt;/p&gt;";</pre>
<pre>$lang['comdisplay1'] = "Showing $first_row-$last_row of $total_rows Comments"; </pre>

<p>The variables (<code>$first_row</code>, <code>$last_row</code> and <code>$total_rows</code> in the above example) are place holders and will be replaced with actual values when the page using that entry is sent to the visitor&rsquo;s browser giving, for example, the message: &ldquo;Showing 1-15 of 36 comments&rdquo;</p>

<p>Note that the file does not affect the language in which dates are displayed. See <a href="date-locale.html">Dates &ndash; language</a>. The last line of the file must be: <code>require 'my-english.php';</code>. That gets your override language file and replaces entries in the primary file with entries from your override language file.</p>

<a name='change'></a>
<h2>Changing text in entries</h2>

<p class='stress'>Take care when editing the language file:</p>

<p>The last statement in a language file must be an include of your <em>my language file</em>. 
If you translate english.php to another language be sure  <code>require 'my-xxxxx.php';</code> as the last statement in that file, where xxxxx is the name of your language file.</p>

<p>Some entries include PHP variables and/or HTML tags. You can shift 
the position of the variables and tags but don't ortherwise alter them. Variable 
names look like <code>$variable_name</code> and <code>{$config['variable_name']}</code> </p>

<p>If you want to use quotes or other special characters in the text, use HTML special character 
codes. For example: <code>&amp;quot;quoted text&amp;quot;</code> produces <code>&ldquo;quoted text&rdquo;</code>. Find the list of codes at <a href='http://www.webmonkey.com/reference/special_characters/' target='_blank'>Web Monkey</a>

If you must use a <code>"</code> character within the text (e.g. in HTML attributes), precede it with a backslash: <code>&lt;p class=\"class-name\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>

<p class='stress'>Changing text in a custom template:</p>

<p>If you are creating a custom template the easiest way to change text is to replace the $lang variable with the actual text you want to appear on the page.</p>

<p>For example to change the comments display template &ldquo;Leave a comment label&rdquo; to &ldquo;Enter a comment&rdquo;, change:</p>
<pre>&lt;p id='tb-comment-link'&gt;&lt;a href='#entry'&gt;{$lang['comdisplay6']}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
to:
<pre>&lt;p id='tb-comment-link'&gt;&lt;a href='#entry'&gt;Enter a comment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>

<p>With a custom template you don&rsquo;t have to worry about your changes being overwritten if you upgrade to a new TalkBack version in the future.</p>

<p class='stress'>Changing text in a default template:</p>
<p>To protect yourself against having your changes overwritten by future releases of TalkBack, copy the <code>english.php</code> entry you want to change to <code>my-english.php</code> and change it there.</p>

<p class='stress'>Finding the language file entry or place in the HTML to change the text:</p>

<p>Open the page you want to change in your browser. Copy the text from the screen to the clipboard. Example: &ldquo;Your email address (will not be published)&rdquo; on the comments form.</p>

<p>Open english.php in your text editor. Invoke the search command and paste the text into the search dialog. That would take you, in this case, to the entry for <code>$lang['comform4']</code>. That is the entry you want to copy and change.</p>

Some possible <em>gotchas:</em>
<ul class='notop'>
<li>If an entry has PHP variables, searching the language file for the text displayed on your browser won&rsquo;t work. &ldquo;Showing 1-15 of 36 comments&rdquo;, for example, does not exist in the language file. In such cases you must open the template, locate the line of HTML/PHP code that prints that text, get the $lang entry name from the line, then search for that entry name in the language file.</li>
<li>Some text labels may occur more than once in the language file. There are, for example, two different entries for the single word &ldquo;Return&rdquo;:

<p><code>$lang['moderation_return_link'] = "Return";</code></p>
<p><code>$lang['return_link_text'] = "Return";</code><br /></p>

<p>So be careful with very short or generic text labels. Do a second search to be sure there is only one. If there are two, change one and see if you got the correct one. If not, undo that and change the other one.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<a name='multi'></a>
<h2>Using multiple language packages</h2>
If you have more than one language file in the <code>/language</code> directory:

<ul>
	<li>The <em>default language</em> is that specified by the config.php <code>DEFAULT_LANGUAGE</code> entry.</li>

	<li>A language icon link for each will be displayed below the &ldquo;Leave a comment&rdquo; link. Clicking an icon changes the text labels and legends to that language.
		<p><img src='languageicons.gif' width='388' height='120' alt='' border='1' /></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>If the edit or reply link in a comment footer is clicked the edit or reply panel will be displayed using the currently selected language.</li>
	
	<li>Admin panels always use the default language. If you click an edit or reply link for a comment in the admin panel, the edit or reply panel will open in the default language.</li>
</ul>

<a name='translate'></a>
<h2>Translating the language file</h2>
<p>You do not have to translate all entries in the primary language file. The file is large and translating all entries would be a daunting task. At the beginning of the file, following the comments, is a table of contents. It identifies which sections contain entries that are seen by visitors to your site and which are seen only by the administrator. You may choose to translate only those sections that contain messages seen by visitors.</p>

<p>Make a new primary language file. Create a new text file named for the language (example: german.php). Copy the entire english.php file to it and then translate the english text in it. The last line of the file must be the include statement for the override language file, example: <code>require 'my-german.php';</code>.</p>

You also need to:
<ul class='notop'>
	<li>make a copy of <code>my-english.php</code> and rename it, for example, <code>my-german.php</code>. Note that the override filename must start with &ldquo;my-&rdquo; and the language name must be the same as the primary language file.</li>

	<li>create an icon for the language. Copy an appropriate GIF file from <code>/talkback/addons/flags</code> to <code>/talkback/language</code> and rename it. For example, to create a Spanish language icon you could copy one of spain.gif, mexico.gif, etc. and rename it spanish.gif.</li>
