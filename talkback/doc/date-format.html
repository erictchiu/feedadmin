<p>The format of dates is specified by the admin_date (for admin panels) and comments_date (for comments templates) in the configuration maintenance panel. These settings contain a &ldquo;format string&rdquo; that is applied to dates. Examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>%m/%d/%y - %H:%M</code> Yields output like: 11/16/06 - 15:15</li>
	<li><code>%B %d, %Y - %H:%M</code> Yields output like: November 16, 2006 - 15:16</li>
</ul>

The following parameters may be used in the format strings on Unix type servers. Note that characters entered into the string without the preceding % will be treated as literals. For Windows servers see this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclib/html/_crt_strftime.2c_.wcsftime.asp" target='_blank'>

<p>Not all parameters may be supported by your system, in which case they will not be supported by PHP function used by TalkBack. Additionally, not all platforms support negative timestamps, therefore your date range may be limited to no earlier than the Unix epoch. This means, for example, %e, %T, %R and %D (there might be more) and dates prior to Jan 1, 1970 will not work on Windows, some Linux distributions, and a few other operating systems.</p>
