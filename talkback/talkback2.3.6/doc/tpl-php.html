<p>Yes, the templates do have some PHP code in them, but that code is not doing much more than printing (sending) HTML to your browser. So don&rsquo;t let the PHP code scare you. Do not change the PHP code unless you know what you are doing. Though, you can move a block of code to a different location in the template if you want to rearrange the layout.</p>

<p>Below is short primer about the types of PHP statements you will see in the templates. The primer won&rsquo;t turn you into a PHP programmer but it will give you insights that allow you to to separate the PHP code from the HTML code as you are viewing a template.</p>


<p class='topic'>Print statement<br />
	Sends the text inside the double quotes to the browser. Example:</p>
<pre>print "
&lt;!-- Language select links --&gt;
&lt;p class='tb-center'&gt;$language_links&lt;/p&gt;";
</pre>
	Your browser ignores indenting and extra spaces, and doesn't care whether or not multiple tags occur on the same line. But I have taken care to print the HTML in such a manner that if you view it with your browser&rsquo;s view source commmand, it will be indented and easy to read.
	
<p class='topic'>PHP variables<br />
	A variable looks like this: <code>$language_links</code> or this <code>$lang['comdisplay6']</code>. The variable contains a value (a piece of information). Think of the variable name as a placeholder. When the script is executed PHP replaces the variable name with the actual contents of the variable.<br /><br />

	Most variables in the templates were created by the driver script (the script that is executed just prior to the template script). But some come from the configuration table array <code>$config['entryname']</code> or the language file array <code>$lang['entryname']</code>. PHP statements use the variables to either decide what action to take or to print the variable to the browser.
</p>

<p class='topic'>If statements<br />
	Determines whether or not an action is done, i.e <em>if condition x do y</em>. Example:</p>
	<pre>if ($x || $y) {	
   print "this text";
}</pre>
	Means: if the variable $x has a value OR $y has a value, print to the browser whatever is inside the double quotes. May also be written as:
	<pre>if ($x || $y) print "this text";</pre>
	You will also see if statements in this format:
	<pre>if (condition 1) {
   print "some text";
} elseif (condition 2) {
   print "some different text";
} else {
   print "the default text";
}</pre>
	Note the use of the { and } characters. { marks the start of an action and } marks the end of an action. Like HTML, PHP code can be mashed together on one line. But I have used multiple lines and indentation to make the code easier to read.

<p class='topic'>For statements<br />
	Causes something to be done a number of times.</p>
	<pre>for($counter = 0; $counter &lt; $some_number; $counter++) {
   do something
}</pre>
	Means: starting with $counter at zero, while $counter is less than the value in $some_number, do something then increment the counter by 1 and repeat the process.

	<p class='topic'>Operators</p>
	<pre>==  is equal to
!=  is not equal to
<   is less than
>   is greater than
||  OR
&&  AND
=   set the value of the variable on the left to the value of the variable or string on the right</pre>

<p class='topic'>Include statments<br />
	Causes another script file to be executed. Examples:</p>
	<pre>include "filename.php";</pre>
	Reads in and executes the file named <em>filename.php</em>.
	<pre>include $config['comments_form_tpl'];</pre>
	Reads in and executes the file whose name is contained in the $config array entry. In this case, the filename is for the comments form template.
