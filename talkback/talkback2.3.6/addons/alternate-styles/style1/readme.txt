An example of this style is on this page: 
http://www.scripts.oldguy.us/talkback/demo/style1.php

style1test.php is a example/test page. You do not need to put it in your TalkBack
directory unless you want to use it for testing.

To use this style:
	Copy my-style.css to the TalkBack directory 
	Change the paths of URL's in the css if they not correct for your installation:
		replace all "/talkback/images"  with  "/path-to-talkback/images"
